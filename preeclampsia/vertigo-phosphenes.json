No eye pain that I've noticed.\u00a0\u00a0The opthamologist who examined me last month did so with my pupils dilated.\u00a0\u00a0At the time I had had several episodes of visual auras - scintillating blobs in one eye that got larger until it disappeared from my view, lasting approx. 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0She diagnosed me with opthalmic migraines.\u00a0\u00a0I had three last Nov/Dec - I have not had any since - just the flashers.thanks",

    "question": "Hi there:About one year ago, I started noticing what I believe are called \"phosphenes\" - little \"sparks\" of light in my field of vision that come and go briefly. I was pregnant at the time I noticed them and was concerned about preeclampsia. Once that was ruled I out I pretty much ignored them. I'm not sure if I've had them for the entire year or if I've just noticed them again recently, but I am noticing them often now for the past two months.Questions:1. I understand phosphenes can be a sign of MS, which worries me.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any other eye-related explanation which could account for these (assuming they are related, which they may not be)?\u00a0\u00a0 I saw an opthamologist in early January about opthalmic migraines and she said my eyes were OK.2. If this were optic neuritis, would it have been picked up by the opthamologist?3. If it were ON, would it have progressed more by now? (I started seeing the phosphenes last year).",
