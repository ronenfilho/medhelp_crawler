I have been having problems with my kidneys with this one, my blood pressure is high for me, the baby is about a month ahead in size and weight, I am 16 weeks and showing signs of gestational diabetes according to the doc. but my doctor has not tested me yet. when do they usually test for this?\u00a0\u00a0i don't remember.\u00a0\u00a0I am really scared. i have had a heart attack since had my girls. I think I am getting preeclamsia again. my hands,feet, and face is swelling but the doc said i don't cuz my blood presure is not high. but it is usually very low since had attack. everone tried to get me to have an abortion but I could not do it. my cardiologist refuses to see me now.\u00a0\u00a0has anyone had children after having a heart attack? Do you have to wait til a certain time before having diabetes test? also my doc says I will be perfectly fine to deliver vaginally but I don't know anyone who has heart problems and not had a c-section. should I get another doctor?",
