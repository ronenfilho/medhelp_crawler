            "answer": "Preeclampsia is usually nothing to worry about with today's medical science. The worst that could happen is you have a c section before your due date. And as for the strep, they just give you an IV of antibiotics when you're in labour and it makes everything fine. I tested positive and we had no problems. Good luck mama! Drink lots of water and elevate your feet as much as you can to help reduce swelling. :)",

    "question": "Just when I could see the light at the end of the tunnel (almost 34 weeks pregnant) I'm so scared about preeclampsia and group b strep! During my 32 week appointment they said my blood pressure was a little high, and I was swelling really bad that week in my hands. But since then I haven't been swollen.I think at this next appointment they'll test me for group b strep..I'm so nervous. This is my first baby, I just want everything to go smoothly.",
