            "answer": "The vitamin D council recommend vitamin D serum level between 50 and 80 ng/mL (125 and 200 nmol/L) year round. The body needs vitamin D for many reasons but two important reasons are to absorb calcium and to activate killer T cells to kill off bacteria and viruses.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin D deficiency is linked to numerous health conditions from cold and flu to cancer so you want to make sure your serum levels are optimal.To avoid symptoms of vitamin D supplementation either increase magnesium in the diet or take magnesium supplements.\u00a0\u00a0If you have kidney disease or severe heart disease take magnesium only under a doctor's supervision. A few excerpts below with more information....Excerpt from the Vitamin D council - Magnesium...\"Magnesium deficiency is epidemic in the United States, with the majority of Americans unknowingly deficient.\u00a0\u00a0This can be problematic when optimizing vitamin D levels. In fact, it is common for rising vitamin D levels to bring up symptoms of an underlying magnesium deficiency.Vitamin D has no known side effects.

A severe deficiency during pregnancy may lead to preeclampsia, poor fetal growth, and even infant mortality.Magnesium and calcium work in combination: Magnesium relaxes muscles, while calcium stimulates muscles to contract. Research suggests that proper levels of magnesium during pregnancy can help keep the uterus from contracting prematurely.\"***Excerpt from The Journal Of Nutrition - High Prevalence of Vitamin D Insufficiency in Black and White Pregnant Women Residing in the Northern United States and Their Neonates...\"In utero or early life vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes (11), asthma (12), and schizophrenia (13,14). Fascinating new data also show that vitamin D regulates placental development and function (15), which suggests that maternal vitamin D status may be associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy, such as miscarriage, preeclampsia, and preterm birth.\"",
