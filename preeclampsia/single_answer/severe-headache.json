    "question": "This morning I woke up with a horrible headache. I'm 25 weeks with twins. I've had them feel like this earlier in my pregnancy when I didn't eat enough or have enough water to drink. I drank just under a gallon of water yesterday and I'm on track with my water drinking today. I might not have had enough food yesterday, but eating isn't helping my headache fade at all. Taking a nap didn't help. I'm slightly worried that nothing is helping because I'm getting into my third trimester. Should I email my Dr? Has anyone had this happen? I'm scared of preeclampsia.",
