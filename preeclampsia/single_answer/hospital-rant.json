    "question": "Alright so I'm back in triage again. But they didn't know I was coming back and had no idea why.... shouldn't they have orders? So anyway I come back for the rest of the tests and then they tell me that they can't take my urine thingy because it's too early and that I have to stay for the extra hour or more till it's been exactly 24 hours from when I started it... ugh my feet are swollen and they won't do anything about it. I'm still having Braxton hicks fairly consistent but I'm not even gonna mention them because I don't feel like having the stupid nurses tonight telling me I'm fine and all the same Crap I've heard over and over... I just want to know if I have preeclampsia why do they have to freaking do all this Crap? Take the blood take the urine and tell me what in the world is going on with me and my baby! I'm 36+4 weeks now I'm at the end if something's potentially wrong I think they'd want to hurry up figure it out and let me know. I'm gonna start tearing my hair out",
