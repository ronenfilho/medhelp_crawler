            "answer": "I actually am going through the same thing. I'm due Feb 27th but baby and belly measure more like Feb 8th. The ultrasound showed he was already 4lbs 10oz. My doctor will not change my due date though and I'm already having a csection. He said he'll watch his weight closely and if he's getting too big or I'm showing signs of preeclampsia again he will schedule the surgery. I had my 2nd daughter via csection 6 years ago and actually preferred that over my previous vaginal delivery. Good luck to you...maybe we'll just have big healthy babies",
