            "answer": "During my last pregnancy my fluid went low in my 28th week. I started drinking a lot of water. 64ozs per day. Later on in the pregnancy I got preeclampsia. In-between 28 weeks and until I got pre-e I started swelling bad. I couldn't get up to use the bathroom without swelling up like an elephant. I did get the fluid back up but o had to be induced because of the pre-e.Are you swelling? Does your baby have any growth restrictions?If so all three combined low fluid swelling and growth restriction could possibly mean you have pre-e without it showing in your urine yet.I would speak to the doctor and find out what you can do to prevent pre- e and find out good ways to get your fluid back up. Don't worry just drink drink drink until you find out the cause.",
