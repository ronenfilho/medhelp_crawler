    "question": "Good evening ladies i have a question to see if this has happened to anyone. I was diagnosed with mild preeclampsia due to blood pressure at 31 weeks and since released have been good no close calls or anything. I had an ultrasound and they told me my baby boy has some fluid around his left kidney which they stated happens at time with boys and after delivery they are fine. But i was wondering is it safe to want to deliver at 40 weeks instead of 37 weeks if not what are some of the dangers in inducing to the mom and early delivery for the baby?",
