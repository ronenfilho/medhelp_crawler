            "answer": "Mine won't be very helpful lol, o was not dilated or effaced at all at 42 weeks so they induced me and they placed the cervidil at about 7 pm and at 10 pm my water broke. I didn't have any contractions of the than the same ones I had been having for 3 days prior, but they will most likely give you pitocen and thoes contractions hurt like a mother\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0good luck lol\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did it all natural for 16 hours with the pitocen until they took him via c-section because he was stuck and his heart rate kept dropping. Make sure you breathe. Do rhythmic breathing, it helps a ton",

    "question": "Just had mine put 5:14 pm yesterday, it is not 1:04 pm where I live, I'm getting irregular cramping, not sure if its contractions or early labor. But I'm hoping something happens soon, pain isn't unbearable but it is uncomfortable. Hurt like a ***** when inserted, if my labor doesn't start within the next 16 hours they'll put in another one. Praying I won't need to.I'm 39 weeks today, I needed to be induced because I had high blood pressure and protein in my urine. They said since I was already to term and there was nothing wrong with me ATM other than those two things they wanted to induce me, only to avoid developing major issues like preeclampsia.If anyone has experience with cervidil feel free to post your story.",
