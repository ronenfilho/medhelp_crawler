            "answer": "Just asked my Dr this question today... She told me that she will let me go as long as possible so she doesn't have to induce me because being induced causes irritation to your uterus and can mess with the scar tissue from the csection and some other things... so unless you have complications at the end of your pregnancy you will have to go into labor naturally if you want to do a vbac bad enough .. I want a vbac but it all depends on how I feel when it gets closer because if I get preeclampsia again I'm obviously just going to go with a csection just to be on the safe side .. my csection wasn't bad at all so I don't mind having another :)",
