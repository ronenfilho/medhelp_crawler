            "answer": "It sounds like you have been through a lot, and you would benefit from consulting a maternal fetal medicine specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Guidelines vary slightly, but typically when a couple has had two or three miscarriages, testing is done to see if a reason can be found. A maternal fetal medicine specialist is a high risk obstetrician. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine website has a physician finder that can help you locate someone in your area.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it may help to see a genetic counselor to discuss the types of genetic tests that might be recommended in your miscarriage workup, and to review your family history to see if anyone else in the family has any miscarriages, issues with fertility, birth defects, or congenital heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0To locate a genetic counselor near you, please use the website for the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC).",
