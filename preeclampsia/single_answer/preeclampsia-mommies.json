            "answer": "Aww, well done mommy! You have done a great job getting your baby this far. It is such a hard fight with preeclamplsia, I really feel for you. I'm always looking out for fellow PET mums as I have found this the most difficult time of my life. I was diagnosed with preeclamplsia with my son at 28wks and fought to get him to 35wks before he was delivered by csection. This time I was diagnosed at 15wks and am currently in hospiral for my 4th time at 26wks. I am desparately hoping to get to 36wks but my dr said we'll aim for 28wks first and if we make that far we'll aim for 34wks. It's really tough and it takes a lot to push your body like that for your baby so I just well done and hang in there!",

    "question": "I woke up this morning and my blood pressure was 146/86. One reading isn't much to go off of. My highest readings the last 2 weeks have been in the morning (symptom of hypertension). I'm giving it an hour with my feet up to take another reading.I was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 29 weeks. My doctor thought I'd be in the hospital on bed rest at 32 weeks. By 33 weeks I started to improve. I'm 36w5d now. I'm getting my induction date at my appointment on Thursday.If\u00a0\u00a0I get another high reading I'll call my doctor. I was so hoping to make it to 38 weeks since I reached my goal of 36 weeks.",
