            "answer": "I was diagnosed with severe preeclamplsia at 28wks. My dr managed to slow it down with blood pressure meds, aspirin and calcium until it took over at 35wks and my baby was born by csection. Originally we had planned to try to get to 38wks and then induction but my body just couldn't do it. My advice would be to do everything the dr tells you - bedrest means bedrest. Good thing is my baby was born fine and preeclamplsia went away for me within a couple of days. Fingers crossed all goes well for you!",
