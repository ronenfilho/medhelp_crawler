Your bp looks good for now but let your dr know if you're worried at your next appointment as their machines are properly checked and callibrated so can give better reassurance.",

    "question": "I checked my blood pressure and it was 106/85. I know the normal range for the bottom number is 80 or lower. 85 is a bit higher than usual for me. I also have a headache that I've had since yesterday afternoon and it won't go away even with Tylenol. Can you develop preeclampsia without having a super high blood pressure?",
