    "question": "Does anyone else have gestational hypertension? At my last appointment they were very concerned and decided to do the 24 hour urine test to see if I had preeclampsia. My levels came back low and they said I was clear for now. Well I had another appointment today and my blood pressure was still high and they informed me that I have to go back biweekly twice a week and they are inducing me at 37 weeks. I just feel so overwhelmed and disappointed. Everything has been going so good and I feel awesome...then boom hello high blood pressure! Instead of 9 more weeks I'll be having my son in 6. I just hope everything goes well and I have a healthy baby.",
