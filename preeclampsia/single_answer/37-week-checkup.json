    "question": "Went yesterday afternoon for my 37 week check up and my blood pressure was high! They sent me to labor and delivery to be monitored and while I was there my blood pressure would go from perfect to kind of high again. They also checked for protein in my urine which came back negative but sent me home with a 24 hour urine test where I have to pee into a jug for 24 hours and then bring it back. They are calling it gestational hypertension for now since they haven't found any protein in my urine so they don't think it's preeclampsia as of right now. I just want my baby to be ok :( is anyone else going through or has gone through something similar?",
