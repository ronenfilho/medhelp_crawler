            "answer": "Ask your hospital about having him room in with you, keep in mind though that this is flu season and that comes with risks. That said, I understand your pain. I was 5 days post partum and admitted through the er for having a BP of 210/110 and heart rate of 32 (post partum preeclampsia). The hospital went out of their way to accommodate me and baby, but it turned out i also came down with strep throat so baby and i were apart for 4 days. I hope you get well soon so you can get back to baby.",

    "question": "Hello ladies. So its been one week since I had my little boy. I am sooooo in love with this little guy! He's so awesome. He doesn't cry a lot just whines when his pacifier Falls out his mouth(which I wasn't planning on giving him one but the women in the nursery made that decision for me and now he can't live without it), to be changed, and to eat. Yesterday he had his first newborn appointment. They said he's doing great, gained 8 Oz's, and is very healthy. I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to attend his appointment because I had to go across the hall to the er because I was having a very hard time breathing. Turned out I have pneumonia(4x) so I had to be admitted last night. I'm still actually sad cause there isn't anything in this world I would rather do then be home with my Mr handsome. My mom is actually watching him for me because daddy has such a hard time waking up if he's crying... But my mom\u00a0\u00a0said he's been whining and been awake all day and night smh which I know is the only reason he's acting like that is because I'm not there. Well just decided to clear my head some. I miss my baby!!!",
