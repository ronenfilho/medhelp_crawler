    "question": "I'm 10 weeks pregnant. I've only been with my bf for a year. I lived alone before that and was independent because I've been burned before and had been a single mom for 9 years...well I got a house with him and I pay half or more of the bills. He became emotionally abusive, calling me names, blaming me for made up issues in his head, telling me to leave my house in the middle of the night...Well, anyway..he told me last night to be out by today with my kids. I told him that I don't have to leave my house so he said that he is leaving. He said he loves me but he can't live with me because he thinks that I disrespect him.I feel releif to not have his abuse but I'm pregnant and I don't want to have a pregnancy and a baby alone. I have had eclampsia and preeclampsia.Also he says he is going to \"take\" the baby from me...I'm just tired of being pushed around and I want a normal life and I won't cry and lay around over this. I just need some encoutagment...",
