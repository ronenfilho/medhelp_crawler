            "answer": "You need to have your TSH FT3 and FT4 monitored frequently, as they may change. Make sure you take your meds, as the baby needs those hormones. The first trimester is the most important for thyroid levels to be accurate, as the fetus can't provide its own. Inadequate levels can result in mental retardation, even miscarriage.That said, I had hypo symptoms for years. I had even stopped menstruating for several months the year I was trying to get pregnant. My TSH (and only TSH) was tested two weeks after I was pregnant as I complained about my constant fatigue to my gynecologist. Wished she had tested my urine too, for, I dunno, pregnancy, since she knew we were trying. Anyway, TSH was in range, so no big deal, right? Well, 37 and a half weeks into my pregnancy, I had developed preeclampsia. Only cure is cesarian. My daughter was born healthy. But I consider that lucky. I wonder what my thyroid levels were then the day I had her. 10 months later my TSH would be 13.34, and finally, only then, received treatment.Preeclampsia has been linked to hypothyroidism, so you'll want to keep an eye out for that. But it shouldn't be an issue if you're meds are correct for your condition.",
