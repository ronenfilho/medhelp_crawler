    "question": "Ok ladies, Im almost 8wks pregnant and a little nervous. This is my 5th pregnancy. 2 miscarriages and then two full term healthy baby boys at 38w1d and 40w after being induced due to preeclampsia both times. I've been fine until earlier today. When I went to pee, when I wiped I noticed some light brown discharge tinged with pink. I called my dr and I have an appointment in 3 hours just to make sure everything is ok. Has anyone else had this happen? I only have slight cramps which is normal for me. I've read some stuff saying it's a sign of twins or something else but Idk about that. Just scared i mah be having another miscarriage. Any info is greatly appreciated.",
