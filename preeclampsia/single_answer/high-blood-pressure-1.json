            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Do you have high blood pressure when you are not pregnant? Do you take any blood pressure medications? My best recommendation would be to talk to your doctor about your concerns. There may be dietary and activity restrictions that your doctor want you to be aware of. Your doctor will want to follow you closely throughout your pregnancy to make sure that your blood pressure remains under control.Congratulations on your pregnancy!Cathy",
