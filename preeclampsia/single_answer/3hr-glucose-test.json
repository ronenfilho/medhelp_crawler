    "question": "I know lots of women fail the 1hr glucose test and then turn around and pass the 3hr test. Im just wondering if anyone knows the odds of me failing my 3hr one on Tuesday. For the 1hr test i fasted. So i didn't have anything to eat or drink and my levels came out to 190. Im not gonna freak out or anything because i still could pass my 3hr one but it would really s u c k if i failed that one too. With my first i had preeclampsia and i was hoping this pregnancy would be a textbook case.",
