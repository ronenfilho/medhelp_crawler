            "answer": "Hello!The commonest cause of weight loss in second trimester is inadequate intake of nutritious food. You need to consult a nutritionist or your gynecologist for eating the right amount and type of food. A sudden drop in fluid retention, preeclampsia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension can all lead to weight loss in second trimester. Other causes are a lack of amniotic fluid or gestational diabetes. Intrauterine growth retardation can also be one of the causes of poor weight gain in the mother. If you do not gain sufficient weight, it can result in premature labor and it can affect your baby's growth. I will advise you to see your gynecologist ASAP.A clinical examination is important. Hope it helps.Good luck!",
