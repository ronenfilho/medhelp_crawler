            "answer": "Hi. I have asthma also and had to take prednisone at 8 weeks after developing a terrible cold. I am 17 weeks now and all looks well with the baby. I was very nervous about taking the medication but the Doctor's assured me it was safe. The only thing they mentioned to me is if you have to take it frequently (more than just for a week here and there) you are more prone to develop preeclampsia or gestational DM. They said that towards the end it is completely safe because it matures the baby's lungs. Good luck and I hope you feel better.",
