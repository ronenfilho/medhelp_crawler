    "question": "I love my man to death! He's going to be a great father. But sometimes he's so silly about the whole pregnancy thing. I just found out I might have preeclampsia and he's saying he's gonna be mad if I've had it this whole time and they didn't catch it sooner. Understandable as that is I'm trying to explain to him that it's not something that has a bunch of symptoms that scream out that I have it or not. And the docs only said I'm borderline. So it's not like I am yet. Plus I'm 36weeks. If I have it then that's fine. Just means my baby girl comes a few days early. I don't want an induction but if that's what it takes for her and me to be healthy then so be it. No big deal right?",
