    "question": "12 years ago I had severe preeclampsia at 32 weeks pregnancy which resulted in a fetal demise.\u00a0\u00a0There was a lot of blood loss due to the placenta ripping fromt the uterine wall...4 days after the experience and when I was in ICU, my blood pressure was very very high and they had trouble controlling it and often used nitroglycerin under my tongue to rapidly decrease my bloo pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I started to have strange color flashes with my vision.\u00a0\u00a0It actually looked like bright color dials going in circular motions.\u00a0\u00a0Then shortly afterward i lost my sight but could see only extreme peripheral vision\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't see things looking straight ahead, only wide angles..this lasted 3 weeks total and then it was healed.\u00a0\u00a0I can see fine now.What is this called, and why did this happen?\u00a0\u00a0What caused the strange blindness?\u00a0\u00a0Please respond with as full of an explanation as you can.Thanks",
