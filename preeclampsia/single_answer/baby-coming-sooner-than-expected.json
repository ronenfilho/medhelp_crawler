    "question": "Well as my blood pressure is rising my doctors want to deliver my baby at 37 weeks. Which is only 2 weeks away. Holy cow. I was thinking I still had 4 weeks to go. And now that's cut in half. Im freaking out here. This is baby number 2 band my daughter, number 1, was born at 39 weeks. I have been procrastinating with buying things for my boy, I still have everything from my daughter, I guess I need to go shopping.\u00a0\u00a0I hope he's ready, they say he weighs enough, already tipping the scales at 6lbs 11 oz, but I hope his lungs will be mature enough. I would wait but my blood pressure keeps getting worse, and all of a sudden. I had this issue with my daughter but it started in the second trimester with her, and was just high. But with this one as of monday it has just skyrocketed. They sent me to the hospital, all my labs came back normal so not preeclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0but its still too high. Now instead of having my son after the new year, Jan 2 we are now looking at before Christmas.\u00a0\u00a0Crazy that his year of birth will be changing. Sorry so long. Just a lot of stuff going through my head right now.",
