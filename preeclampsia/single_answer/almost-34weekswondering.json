            "answer": "I've been in the same situation but it all started at week 33. You might have preeclampsia but they should definitely do at least a 24h urine test and 24 blood pressure monitoring to confirm it. I've been put on bed rest because my tests didn't confirm preeclampsia 100% but did show that I am at high risk to develop it. They actually wanted to keep me in the hospital for monitoring until delivery but I refused and doing the same at home (monitoring BP and urine protein levels with dipstick tests). I am now week 38 so whatever happens the baby is now full term.If they do confirm preeclampsia and they can't keep it in control they will induce you because it's a life threatening condition both for you and the baby.",

    "question": "I'm wondering if anyone has had anything similar happen. I am almost 34 weeks and went to the doctors today. They found protein in my urine and my blood pressure has always been high. They took more blood work. My question is..did anyone else have this happen... A woman on here said she was being induced 2weeks early because of the same issue. I just want my baby girl to cook as long as possible. Thanks in advance! You ladies are a great support system.",
