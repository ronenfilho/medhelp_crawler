            "answer": "High blood pressure is kind of the across the board indication of pre eclampsia. Swelling CAN be an indicator, but if it's occurring without hbp it's not as likely to be connected. I haven't heard of weight gain indicating pre eclampsia so I don't know about that but it's definitely something to bring up at a doc appointment if you're worried.
