    "question": "When I went to have my anatomy scan done the doctor there ordered me do get a comprehensive metabolic blood test done and a 24 hour urine sample. I know they are going to test my urine for protein but I had a regular ob appointment that same day and they said my urine was fine because have to have a sample every visit. It kinda worries me because with my anatomy scan they couldn't see everything they needed to see and check on when I asked that doctor why he just said everything they could see was good. I go back on the 29th for another ultrasound hoping everything is ok since I do not know why I was ordered those tests. Oh and my blood pressure is always good never higher than 120/65 its usually 117/65",
