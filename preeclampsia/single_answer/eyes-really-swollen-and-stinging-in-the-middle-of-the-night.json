    "question": "Hi, I was just wondering, last night I woke up and my eyes were stinging really bad, and my whole face looked kind of swollen - but there was no swelling whatsoever anywhere else. I put a cold cloth on them for a while and when I woke up I was fine. Could it have been sinus stuff? (Although my eyes usually don't sting that bad or swell like that.)",
