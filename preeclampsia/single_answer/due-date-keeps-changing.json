            "answer": "It depends.... Sometimes the ultrasound techs are not good... I've seen it and could do better quite frankly just from hearing the instruction going on.My friend's niece had the same issue. But she was also in preeclampsia, very swollen and they thought he'd be huge.... He came out I believe 7 lbs and some odd oz. So not too big at all. They moved her up 2-3 weeks from her original due date. She lost her mucus plug just before her induction date so they delayed induction a few more days to see if he'd come out without being induced... That didn't happen :/It'll depend but the baby will come when ready. That's happened to some and the baby came out on or about the original date too",

    "question": "My original due date was May 1st,2016. It was then changed to April 27th,2016. Every time I go for an ultrasound (once to twice a week now) my expected due date according to the baby's ultrasound keeps changing. First it said April 24th then 2 weeks later it said April 20th. Last week it said the 16th. I go for my next ultrasound in 2 days. My question is this, if the ultrasound's predicted date is based on measurements of the baby will the doctor change my due date again or is the baby just going to be huge?",
