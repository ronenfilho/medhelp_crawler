            "answer": "I'm 30 weeks and I take my blood pressure every morning and night. Although my blood pressure is fine my pulse rate climbs significantly by the 2nd time. Usually between 100 abd 130. I went to my doctors yesterday about this. She checked my urine for protein and preeclampsia but was negative. She said it's normal because your baby is growing abd pushing everything up. Exercise will help your lung capacity and in turn your breathing. So it doesn't hurt to check with your doctor but that's what I was told.",
