            "answer": "Hello,Get the swollen leg immediately evaluated because although it is normal in pregnancy, but it is important to rule out any pre eclampsia. A headache that won\u2019t go away, along with vision changes (like blurriness or sensitivity to light), can be signs of preeclampsia (pregnancy-specific high blood pressure).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Not sire if this is where i should ask but im 6 months pregnant just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes i developed this red spot on my leg a few days ago since that test was done and its continuing to get larger and swell and hurt more its now basically my whole calf. Is this something that can happen in relation to this?? My Dr. is out of town and sadly the drs at the walk ins where i live ignore most of what i tell them and try and convince me that i just bumped my leg and it will go away which i didnt. So im frustrated in pain and its getting worse.",
