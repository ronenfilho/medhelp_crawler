            "answer": "Hi there and welcome.\u00a0\u00a0Well, congratulations on your pregnancy and you are almost finished with it!!\u00a0\u00a0Trust me, your little one will be here before you know it as time flies by so hang in there!!I had pregnancy hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0This can lead to preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't develop it.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that hypertension during pregnancy is a bit different than regular hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0While I have greater odds of eventually developing hypertension later in life, my blood pressure went back to normal upon giving birth.\u00a0\u00a0So, I tell you this because if you were to develoop preeclampsia, it would not be due to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, stress is a factor in blood pressure----\u00a0\u00a0but again, pregnacy hypertension is different.\u00a0\u00a0So, try not to worry about that.I would picture and visualize that a lot of what you are feeling is due strictly to the additional hormones floating around in you.\u00a0\u00a0They are responsible for growing your beautiful baby but do tend to make us more vulnerable to difficult and uncomfortable emotions.\u00a0\u00a0So, put the hormones in their place.\u00a0\u00a0They are just a temporary inconvenience!!\u00a0\u00a0They do not own you but just have to be dealt with during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It really helps me to visualize things like that to help me feel in control of what is going on in my body.\u00a0\u00a0YOU are the boss of the hormones and you tell them to quiet down.Really important to do all the 'other' things right now if you are not taking medication as you usually do.\u00a0\u00a0This includes speaking with a therapist.\u00a0\u00a0This would be so important now as a source to vent your fears and put them in perspective!\u00a0\u00a0I'd also make sure you exercise in moderation each and every day as this helps regulate mood and relieve stress (not to mention---\u00a0\u00a0good for your heart.)\u00a0\u00a0Not sure what your exercise level was before pregnancy but certainly a brisk walk daily would be great.\u00a0\u00a0They have yoga programs for pregnant women.\u00a0\u00a0Eat well.\u00a0\u00a0Medication is calming.\u00a0\u00a0Use some deep breathing techniques (square breathing is one, breath in for 4, hold 4, breath out for 4, hold 4, repeat).\u00a0\u00a0Spend time with friends/family, stay active.\u00a0\u00a0Play music you love around the house, garden, whatever gives you calming pleasure.And if it intensifies, do talk to your doctor again.Don't worry about preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0You say that your blood pressure has been good during the pregnancy so this should not be something you fear.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",
