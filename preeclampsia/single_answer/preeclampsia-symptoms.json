            "answer": "I'd probably go get it checked out. This is my seco d time with it and both times my symptoms have been extreme swelling that wont go down with rest over days, blinded by white spots, pain in right side, headaches, high bp (170/140 the first baby, 160/90 this baby) and protein in wee. Without the protein it is gestational hypertension. Either way if you're worried you should go get your bp checked because the sooner they pick it up they can start managing it. Good luck!",

    "question": "36 weeks ftm due September 26th. It feels like these symptoms showed up over night. My feet have swollen to ridiculous size. They are to the point that I can't wear any shoes other than my flip flops. My fingers are swollen too. My OB said I have a bit of protein in my urine and an excess of amniotic fluid. And I've been having migraines for the past couple of days. I understand that you guys aren't doctors, but it's there anyone who has been diagnosed with preeclampsia and can give me any tips? I have an appointment in two days but does this sound severe enough to go to the hospital now? Thanks in advance!",
