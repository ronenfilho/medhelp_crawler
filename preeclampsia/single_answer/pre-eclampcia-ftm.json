            "answer": "Preeclampsia can cause seizures due to extremely high blood pressure. They'll probably put you on blood pressure meds and you will most likely be on strict bedrest. You might be in the hospital the remainder of your pregnancy. If they can't get your blood pressure to come down, they'll probably take the baby early as it's dangerous for both of you and goes away once you're no longer pregnant. If it's that severe they'll give you steroid shots to help baby's lungs develop.",
