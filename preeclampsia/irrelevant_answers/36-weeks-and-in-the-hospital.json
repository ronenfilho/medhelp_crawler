    "question": "Ok so yesterday i had my 36 week appointment. They ended up sending me into the hospital to be monitored for high blood pressure. No big deal thought I would be there a couple of hours and then I'd be going home. Boy was i wrong! Turned out one of my blood counts was off, and they found protein in my urine. So my doctor wanted to keep me over night for monitoring. Turns out I have preeclampsia and they are now taking about induction. They are keeping me again and doing a 24 hour urine test to count how much protein i am releasing. So its been a long night and day. And looks like its heading that way again. My little girls heart beat is strong. She is a fighter just like her momma. The nurse says that the baby would still be considered pre mature but is likely to go home with me when the time comes if they happen to induce.\u00a0\u00a0But I am a firm believer that prayer works, so any and all prayers are greatly appreciated. I will keep everyone up to date as i can.",
