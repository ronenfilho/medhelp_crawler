You could also go the other route and cut him some slack as he might be feeling anxious about becoming a daddy.",

And now that I have to go more often because of gestational diabetes I dont expect him to go to all of them. I know that u might feel frustrated because hes doing what he wants to do but maybe he wants time for himself before the baby comes. The important part is he helps when the baby is born. Dont stress about it now.",

He hasn't bought anything he says his contribution is paying the bills and providing the roof over our heads. Smh he has become secretive about what he buys now because I told him his priorities are all messed up he'll buy mary Jane and beer but can't buy a box of pampers. Our little girl is going to need more than a roof over her head to survive. Smh I feel like I could of did this by myself because I'm doing it now and I'd say I'm doing a pretty great job. 7days til due date and he still can't get it together.",

But I feel when someone, specifically my husband, says he's going to be there with me for every appointment and then backs out because of one night of video games and beer that is extremely disrespectful and unsupportive. He gets his time alone as he only works part time and I pull 90+ hours a week for work.",

He didnt need to miss a whole day of work for a 5 min appt.....Now with that said, if he took work off for it or just happened to be off work that day he would definitely be there. I would not be ok with what he is doing. He needs to go to your next appt so maybe your dr can enlighten him on pre-e so he's not just hearing it from you. And i would never just ignore it and let him get away with it, because he will just keep doing it. Not all men act like that.\u00a0\u00a0I know someone just like that, though. Has 3 kids and doesn't help the mom whatsoever. It's quite sad and it's hard to be around because the mom is great and works so hard and has a job. Luckily that bothers my hubby a lot and i know my hub helps out as much as possible and he works right now and i'm not because we moved and he suggested i wait til after baby.",

    "question": "I'm 32 weeks and I have preeclampsia. It was suspected at 28 weeks and confirmed at 30. I have weekly appointments with weekly ultrasounds and bpps. Mt husband this morning decided that because these are 'routine' visits he doesn't have to come anymore unless it's a 'big' appointment.What grinds me is that he has taken every thursday off until my october 16th due date so he can attend the weekly appointments. Then after a late night of video games and beer drinking (till 3 am) he decided he doesn't have to go. I was so mad at him this morning I just left the apartment for work and forgot all my food for the day (12 hour work shift).He's been having like this 'last hurrah' over the last three weeks. He returned to smoking (afyer being clean since March) and drinking way more than normal. He won't help put baby stuff together.\u00a0\u00a0Won't help with the dog or making amy of our meals. I feel like I'm doing everything by myself.",
