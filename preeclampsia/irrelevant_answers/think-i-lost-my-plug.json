    "question": "My due date was 19th but found out other day doc has changed to 23rd, which i think is crazy at this point. They didnt even check my cervix tuesday bc they said i hadnt progressed much from last 2 appts. I just went to pee and felt like something plopped out, i looked and it was small yellowish glob. Yesterday i felt nauseous and stomach felt a little funny. What do you think? I dont remember losing with first 8 years ago so this is new to me. I was induced before for preeclampsia.",
