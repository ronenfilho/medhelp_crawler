            "answer": "Can you get your BP measured.I am also considered high risk for preeclampsia with GD, being older, and having quite a bit of swelling (goes right up my legs and my fingers are always stiff these days).I have a home BP monitor and check my BP twice a day. If it goes\u00a0\u00a0up, you can bet I'll be running to the doctors..... but so far so good...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I also get to do urinalysis every couple of weeks to check on things there too..... so far so good.If you have any concern do call your Ob. That's what they are there for and it's their job to make sure you and your baby are healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Am really glad you are seeing your Dr. on Monday, but pre-eclampsia can develop very quickly and be life threatening for the baby (and you), so if you still are feeling wierd please call.",

            "answer": "Since I had Pre-eclampsia or \"toxemia of pregnancy,\" I can tell you through experience, that headaches, swelling of the arms or legs (usually legs) increased fatigue, protein in the urine, blurred vision, brisk reflexes and very high blood pressure are symptoms of pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0This can be a medical emergency, if not taken care of promptly.I don't want to scare anyone, but it can lead to seizures and worse, very quickly, if not addressed by your OB. There is alos decreased blood flow through the placenta to the baby. This is NOT something you want to wait to call your doctor on.Kate is you are EVER concerned that things are just not quite right, call your OB right away.\u00a0\u00a0The decreased fetal movement can be caused by alot of things.\u00a0\u00a0But if your baby was an active kicker or roller and that movement suddenly changes, this is a reason in itself to get in touch with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You need to be assessed.\u00a0\u00a0Your health and the baby's health is not worth waiting....Please take care of yourself dearheart and that precious little one.All the best and many good wishes,HeatherMS Forum",

    "question": "Hi Ladies,I'm going to call my OB after I get off work today (in about an hour), but I was wondering if any of you have had these concerns about preeclampsia and developing or possibly developing it.My baby hasn't moved nearly as much as normal in the past 3 days and the movements feel a lot less strong.\u00a0\u00a0I'm only getting 2 or 3 really good jabs a day now.\u00a0\u00a0And Baby was a tiny bit behind on growth at the last appointment.I'm getting very dizzy at random times and nauseous as well, very sudden onset and I don't have a cold or sinus problems currently (just got over being sick and feel great when I'm randomly nauseous).I'm eating normally and am at 29.4 weeks pregnant and this is my first baby.\u00a0\u00a0My anemia check came back normal at my 28 week appointment, so that was great.I guess I'm just hoping that I can call and talk with the OB/nursing staff, and not have to go in if not necessary.\u00a0\u00a0It just feels like I'm always having to go in if I call them for any reason and that makes me feel like I'm being super paranoid.",
