            "answer": "Well done momma for getting your baby this far! This is my second time with preeclamplsia so I know its a rough journey! Try to focus on how well you've done to get this far and not how early baby is. I had my son at 35wks and he only required one week of nicu due to breathing and feeding, if it wasn't for that ge would have been fine, completely developed and big at that point. Don't be too rough on yourself if it takes a little longer for your milk to come in if you want to breastfeed. I tried with my son and a nurse helped me attempt feeding and pumping in between feeds to help build supply in those first couple of days. Also, I had a csection and the next day I still had preeclamplsia but the day after that it was gone and I felt fantastic again. Fingers crossed it goes well for you!",
