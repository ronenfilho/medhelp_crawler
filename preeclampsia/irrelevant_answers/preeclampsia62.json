            "answer": "Hi there I got diagnosed with preeclampsia and chronic hypertension at 33 weeks exactly they admitted me to the hospital and told me I'd most likely stay there until I deliver or 37 weeks would be more ideal they said. I had to get my vitals checked every 3-4 hours and was put on labatalol and hydrolozen for my blood pressure to control it. I made it to almost 34 weeks and my blood pressure shot up and wouldn't go back down so I got induced that evening and had her just hours later. She's doing very well however she's been in the hospital now for over a week due to premature lungs even though I had those injections before she was born to mature them. She still needed extra help to breathe on her own. But she's looking great. The week that I spent in the hospital was annoying because I have a 2 year old at home that didn't understand why I had to be there and also because well nobody likes to just lay around in bed all day you know. But my only advice would be to keep her inside you for as long as you can at least past 35 weeks every day that the baby stays inside you increase the possibly of the baby being healthier and be able to go home with you. My daughter was born at 33 weeks 6 days weighing 5lbs 3 oz good luck and hang in there",

My baby was 4lbs6oz and spent a week in the NICU just trying to gain weight, maintain her body temp, and she was just a little jaundice. She is a very healthy, smart 6 month old. I hated being hooked up to the BP cuff and all the fluids and magnesium so I feel for you! I'll pray everything goes well :)",

            "answer": "Hi. I was diagnosed with preacclampsia at 33 + 1. I went in for a scan to check the position of my placenta as it was low lying and they said the baby wasn't growing. I went back for another appointment 2 days later and was due to have the baby by c section in another 2 days but because my BP kept going up I had her that night. She was a tiny 2 pound 10. They said that if I hadn't had that apointment I would have lost the baby and I wouldn't have made it either. I'm glad to hear your has been diagnosed at the right stage. My daughter came out of NICU 5 days ago after only being in there 2 weeks. She's only 3 pound 8 now! Best of luck to you.",
