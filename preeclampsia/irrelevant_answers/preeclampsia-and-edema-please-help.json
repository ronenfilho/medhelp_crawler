            "answer": "Hello, this is my 2nd pregnancy with preeclamplsia and I hear ya, painful swelling is not fun. Are you on any bp meds? It could be you need them adjusted. Otherwise unfortunately preeclamplsia can change pretty quickly if your symptoms aren't being managed. If you are concerned at all I would just go in. I've had to call l&d before on the weekend because my ob is closed and they've told me its normal then seen my dr on monday morning and he's had me admitted. Told me to just tell l&d I'm coming in, don't bother arguing with them. Wishing you and baby all the best!",
