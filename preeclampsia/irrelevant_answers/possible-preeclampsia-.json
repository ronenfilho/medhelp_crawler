With her second she had pre-eclampsia and ended up doing an emergency c section(even though she had one scheduled already), and since they watched her she had no problems! If you're being watched I wouldn't worry too much! My doctor is monitoring me for it because at 20 weeks my blood pressure had started rising. I'm only 25 weeks, so hoping it stays low enough they don't put me on bed rest!",
