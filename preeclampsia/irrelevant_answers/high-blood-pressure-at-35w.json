    "question": "I almost have preeclampsia. I went in for my regular OB clinical check up, and they determined that my blood pressure was too high. So they monitored me for five hours. Come to find out my BP was jumping from good to bad but not in the preeclampsia rang. They also said that I had a little protein in my urine.So I have to do a 24hour urine sample, where I pee in this half of gallons container. I'm not excited about all this be if my BP don't go back to normal they will induce me at 37w, that's two weeks from now. My daughter will be healthy and consider full term. My OB also cchecked my cervix and she said I'm 1.5cm dialated, she said that is good considering I'm a Ftm.",
