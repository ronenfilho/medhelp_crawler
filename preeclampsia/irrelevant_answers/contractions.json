    "question": "This is my second pregnancy, my first was born at 36 weeks due to preeclampsia via c-section (almost 6 years ago) and I had horrible back pain which I was told was from preeclampsia. But I guess my question is what do actual contractions feel like so I kind of have an idea of what to watch for? Also what do Braxton hicks feel like as I never experienced these with my first.",
