I slip the minute my butt hits the chair, bed, floor, anything lol I'm constantly able to sleep. I wear a whole shoe size up on certain days, because my feet swell up, and I don't wear rings but I can't close my hands sometimes. I experience pains, mild cramping, and at least a headache a day, and no prenatal vitamins.",

    "question": "I'm worried that I may have preeclampsia, but I don't know if I'm worried enough to go in before my appointment next week. Over the past few days, I've been extremely exhausted and have been actually sleeping for long periods (at least 6 hours) without having to get up to pee, which is a first for this pregnancy. I have also had swelling in my hands on and off where some days I can put on my wedding ring and others I can't. I have stomach pains and mild nausea, and mild headaches off and on. Are these normal pregnancy things, or should I be more concerned? I've made sure I'm drinking plenty of fluids, so I know I'm not dehydrated. I've also been taking my prenatal vitamins, so it shouldn't be an iron deficiency. Please help!",
