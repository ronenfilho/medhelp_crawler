            "answer": "Tired my first son was born at 32 weeks, as far as I was aware to give baby the best chance with lung development you need two shots of the steriods in the twelve hours prior to birth, that is what I got and my baby did not need any help with his breathing at birth. I was considered higher risk for my second pregnany but steriods were never suggested. I did have to have a planned c seation at 37 weeks and two days prior I had an amnio to check for lung maturity, they would have given me steriods at that point if necessary but the tests came back that baby's lungs were mature. If it makes you feel better and there are no risks or side effects with the steroids then why not.Annice; I had the steroid shots, my son had no breathing problems at birth and was not ventilated but he still had grade three brain bleeds, I know another mom who's baby was born at 30 weeks, no steroids and was ventilated and he did just fine and had no brain bleeds. Unfortunately the whole brain bleed issue is just a case of bad luck sometimes. But I agree preemies do seem to, in general, have a better outcome when the mom got the steroids.",

            "answer": "i wouldn't have an early baby because of her- it would be because of my complications (althought it did begin to affect her in weight gain and such which is why they did the c-section at 36 weeks 0 days).i appreciate all of your input. Obviously, i wouldn't hesitate at all if there were signs of a problem. i was wondering about giving them preemptively when all seems to be going well. Your stories convinced me to go ahead and do it. Now I'm just wondering why they bother with amnios to test for lung maturity if steroids have no negative effects. Or is that only done in cases where waiting is an option? I think they didn't bother last time because waiting wasn't an option. It's interesting- the morning i found out i had to devliver, i asked the dr about dd's lungs, since we were only 36 weeks. He said that he wasn't concerned because babies in distress at that stage in pregnancy have their lungs mature faster in response. I don't know if that's the reason why, but dd had absolutely no problems with her lungs (thank God!).",

    "question": "I had an appointment today, and my OB mentioned that he will give me steroids at 34 weeks as a preemptive measure in case I develop preeclampsia again. Is he being overcautious? He said there are no potential negative effects on the baby. I know my risks are not as high as last time, but I can't help but feel like he thinks there's a decent chance of complications again. He's treating me as high-risk and seeing me more frequently than in my last pregnancy. He's taking measurements at each u/s and mentioned that studies show that measure can indicate potential problems before the hypertension sets in. So far he's always made it a point to mention that the baby's measurements are very good.Anyone get steroids for lung development preemptively? I hate to say it, but from the beginning of this pregnancy I've had a feeling something will go wrong. I don't get these premonitions often, but when I do, they're usually right. With my last pregnancy, i KNEW that i was going to have problems and that I'd have the baby before my shower. I was right. I can't shake that feeling this time, and this is kinda reaffirming my underlying fears.by the way, it's not that I don't trust him. I trust him with my life. He is seeing me every 2-3 weeks, and taking very good care of me. It does give me some peace of mind. I guess I want to know if this is typical...",
