I was only 2-3 cm dialated so after the 12 hours they gave me a pitocin drip through an IV for a couple hours, I dialated to a 4 after all that time. So the doctor broke my water and waited a couple hours. Still no improvement so I had to have a c section at that point.",

            "answer": "I had preeclampsia with my son. I went to 37+2 before they induced me. I was dialated 1.5cm and only 30% thinned. They started my induction at 5pm on Monday and had me hooked up to an IV the whole time as it reduces the risk of seizures. They kept giving me pills to dialate me further until 11am Wednesday. I had only dialated to 4 by then, so they broke my water. Things went quickly then and I gave birth at 3:38pm.At 34 weeks, I was at 1cm and 36 I was at 1.5cm. Stayed there until induction. If you have braxton hicks, they do help dialate you. Many women start dialating before they ever check so it may happen without you realizing it.Good luck! Looks like we wont be delivering as close together as we thought! Lol",

That's when his lungs will be fully developed to breath on their own.I remember reading that you love sinking cokes. You should try cutting down because they contain 4 tablespoons of salt per can. A huge influence on your blood pressure. If you can kept it down at you appointmnts, they may let you go a bit longer for baby's sake. I cut down to one can every 2 days from about 3-4 cans a day.
