    "question": "Can your hands swelling mean something other then preeclampsia? I noticed mine were swollen today and my feet also since yesterday. I'm kinda worrying myself. I looked into the symptoms of it. And I realized earlier today I told my BD I was seeing spots but haven't again since. And at my appointment on thursday my doc mentioned I gained 4 lbs in a week and it wasn't baby she said it had to be fluid but I was swollen or anything at the time. I think I'm just worrying myself but ftm so I don't know what's normal or not.",
