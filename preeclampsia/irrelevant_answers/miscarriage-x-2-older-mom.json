    "question": "i had a miscarraige in july 2010 around 6-7 weeks. never had an ultrasound had the miscarriage naturally. decided to try again in 9/10 nothing ever happened. i got pregnant without trying 10/11 and had a successful (mostly) pregnancy and had my boy early 7/2/12. he was due 7/28 but i had bad preeclampsia so they had to deliver him early. i came off bc pill july 2013 with thoughts of baby #2 by end of 2014. i got pregnant in late 9/13 or early 10/13. baby grew to 8 weeks 4 days. i had no symptoms till 11 weeks when i had sharp pain and bleeding. ultrasound showed baby stopped growing at the 8w4d mark. i had to have a d and c. we chose to have chromosomal testing. it showed trisomy 21/down syndrome. the dr told me based on the test it was very likely the heart would not have survived to birth. it was a boy. i wonder since i literally just turned 38 last week what my chances of having a healthy child again. i am borderline depressed about this. if i didn't have my little boy i think i would be in trouble mentally. thoughts? experiences?",
