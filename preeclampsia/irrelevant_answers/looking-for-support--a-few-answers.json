            "answer": "Hey honey! To be completely honest I have never had any problem with my blood pressure during my pregnancies but I was younger with my first two babies, but I did have a friend that had her first baby at 19 and she also had this pre-eclampsia diagnosis when she hit 37 weeks or so and hers was terrible. I really hope that you don't have to go through induction and that Mathew decides to come on his own. It is very exciting that your contractions are starting again (and since you had your steroid shot at 32 weeks then you know he will be absolutely fine) and I really hope that the contractions bring on a baby!!!! Please keep us updated on how you are doing and how your contractions are coming along!",

            "answer": "thanks girl, mine wasnt too bad when they found it at the doctors office on thursday (or they would have induced me or given me a c-section right away) but ive read with preeclampsia that things and progress pretty quickly....so i dont know how it will look on monday..hopefully the bedrest has helped my BP go down some.My contractions are still coming at every ten minutes and havent gotten more painful yet (i wish i could get up and help them along!! but im stuck in bed lol). I am getting some of those sharp lighting bolt type pains in my vagina about every 2 minutes but i suspect Matthew is punching a nerve...or rolling on one? im also very crampy....and so the waiting begins!!",

So, whats the deal? how long is this gonna take?!",

            "answer": "If you're continuing, even if they're only ten minutes apart you may want to consider getting checked, if they're doing their job they're dilating you and me personally I'd be more worried about delivering in the car on the way to the hospital, maybe if you go in for them being ten minutes apart they'll tell you to put on your gown and get you going! I'm not sure though as I've never been in labor, Elijah was a c-section baby but they did tell me once I was past 36 weeks they wouldn't stop any contractions. I hope this is it for you!!!",

            "answer": "hm, i didnt think about the contractions raising my blood pressure more...that could be true. i took a bath and they seemed to slow to 15 minutes apart so maybe its just a fluke? i dont feel very concerned because weirdly the contractions dont hurt too much...its just cramps in my lower belly.. like i\u00a0\u00a0feel like i have to poop really bad (lol kind of a gross example!) and then its gone and then 15 minutes later its back again. If it remains throughout the night i'll definitely get checked out in the morning but if it calms down id really rather stay home so i can get a really accurate urine collection for the pre eclampsia tomorrow. im hoping that im dilated Monday at my appointment and they just set up an induction date because of the pre-e.smjmekg- im not too worried about giving birth in the car i only live 15 minutes away (in traffic) from my hospital and id rather stay home as long as i can during early labor so i dont have to be in the hospital for a million hours to give birth (as long as its safe for me and baby..but i do have to keep the pre-e in mind) its just a difficult decision because i dont exactly know how the pre-e is progressing it was a pretty mild case when they found it and i feel less puffy now after being on bedrest...so hopefully its helped my bp to go down but i really have no idea!",

    "question": "Hi ladies, its been awhile..just a little update and a couple questions...So, as most\u00a0\u00a0of you know i had some preterm starting at 32 weeks and was let off of bedrest at 36 weeks and was told i didnt have to take my contraction meds anymore (yay!).Well, i went to the doctors on Thursday for my regular weekly appointment and DF and i just went waltzing into my appointment feeling great because i wasnt even having anymore contractions. I've had a problem with swelling and retaining fluid my whole pregnancy but just started to all of a sudden get very puffy within the last week or two but i didnt really think anything of it...just figured i was fat and puffy like all of us third trimesterers lol! Well she weighed me and i gained 7 pounds in a week (holy crap!) lol then she checked my blood pressure and it was high...then she dipped my pee and she found proteins...then she sent me over to get an NST and thankfully everything looks just perfect with baby and my placenta. they also took blood and the blood tests looked pretty good...so we didnt need a rushed induction or c-section! Instead they sent me home on bed rest (sigh) and gave me a jug to do a 24 hour urine collection tomorrow (gross) and they want me to come back on monday to turn in the pee (cant believe i have to walk around with a jug of my own urine lol) and to get another blood test....to recheck my BP and to get another NST. I suppose if everything looks good ill be returning for another appointment on thursday to recheck my BP and to get another NST.They have been talking about an induction if things are progressing since my cervix is almost thinned out all the way anyway and i was wondering if anyone knows how things usually go with this pre eclampsia bussiness? I read on the internet that even if your condition remains mild they usually induce if your past 37 weeks...i'll be 38 weeks on thursday and would personally be stoked with an induction date...for numerous reasons...one because im huge, uncomfortable and sick of bedrest and for two because my son already weighs 7lbs and he had his steroid shots for his lungs at 32 weeks...so i know he will be just fine! plus reading about preeclampsia kinda scared me and i would feel more comfortable with him out here so i dont have to worry about my placenta not supporting him!!As a side note...i started getting contractions again about an hour and a half ago, they dont hurt much at all but they are very regular...every 10 minutes on the nose and i have a very funny \"impending change\" feeling going on. It makes me wonder if he has finally decided to come on his own anyway with or without the preeclampsia induction...i guess all i can do is wait it out and see if they get closer together and increasingly painful.i know i didnt ask very many questions that can be answered..im just looking for some support and maybe some insight from some people who have been there!",
