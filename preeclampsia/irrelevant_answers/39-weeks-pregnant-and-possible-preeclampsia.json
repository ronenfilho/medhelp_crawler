            "answer": "I'd wait until you get the results of the 24 hr urine collection before you jump to any conclusions. If you don't have to get induced I wouldn't, a lot of times inductions can end in a c-section, especially if they break your water. Baby will come out when he/she is ready, and I know the last couple weeks are the hardest because you're SOOOO ready for baby to be born, but hang in there and take it one step at a time! Good luck!",

Inductions are really hard on your body and give you a realy hard labor.",

    "question": "I'm 39 weeks pregnant my cervix is fully effaced and I'm one centimeter dilated. In my last three visits to my doctor they have found my Blood Pleasure elevated every time this happens I get sent to the Birthing center to monitor my blood pleasure and a stress test. My Blood Pleasure usually goes down a few points, But they let me go home after. I'm super swollen in my hands and feet they usually go down a bit when I get up in the morning. Plus I experience some inconsistent headaches they feel like migraines. My OBGYN sent me home to collect urine for 24 hours. The Question is CAN THIS BE PREECLAMPSIA? should I ask to be induced?",
