            "answer": "Oh honey, you'll be alright. I had it severely with my first as well. Was in and out of hospital from 28wks trying to get as far along as possible. Blood pressure tablets, bedrest, and drinking lots of water, injections for babies lungs got us to 35wks before it went full blown and baby was delivered by csection. Baby spent a little time in NICU and then was fine and a couple of days after i had no sign of the PE. I know its such a shock and you probably feel awful on top of being terrified but drs are so switched on these days. You can do this. Good luck!",
