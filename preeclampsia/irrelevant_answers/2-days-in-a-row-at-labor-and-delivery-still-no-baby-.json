            "answer": "I had pre-eclampsia and was induced at 38 weeks, they have to monitor you because you could have a fit or seizeur in whoch case they would need to do an emergency c-section, it can also effect the blood flow to the baby so they would have had to check the trace of the baby to make sure it had good excelerations and no decelerations, n not under stress,With pre-eclampsia there is a chance ( not in\u00a0\u00a0your case tho your bp was high but not right ) high) that it could turn in to eclampsia which is really dangerous for mum and baby :)Id take some relaxing baths put your feet up and relax! Keep that bp down",

I was hoping to be able to work and continue school right up until 40 weeks. Oh well! I guess my body didn't like that plan! I do feel like I lost my mucus plug this morning so maybe the baby is coming early! I'll be 38 weeks on Monday.",

    "question": "My bp has been high twice when I went to the doctor so they keep sending me to l&d for no reason! I have to lay there for hours for my bp to normalize which it always does! I think its nerves or something, yesterday when they let me go my bp was 118/78 (down from 151/103). Anyone else have these issues? It's not really preeclampsia I don't think--just fluctuations. Btw I'm 37w4d and ready for this baby to come already! Also wondering what does the mucus plug look like? Is it bloody like bright red or brown?",
