    "question": "I work with a lot of nurses and they all have me freaking out. I woke up around midnight with a severe headache took some tylenol then went back to bed. When I woke up to go to work, I still had a bad headache so I took some more tylenol. The nurses said it may be preeclampsia even though my BP isn't high right now. I don't go back to the doctor until next Friday, should I call my doctor just in case? I am kind of scared because I don't want to go on bed rest this early, I am only 25 weeks 3 days. Also, I haven't been having a decrease in my urine output, I am not swollen anywhere. I just have the severe headache. Just curious if anybody else has been told they have preeclampsia now or with a previous pregnancy. Thank you much.",
