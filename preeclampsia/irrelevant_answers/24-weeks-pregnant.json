I don't know anything about it but I was also anemic while pregnant, so I just had to take some iron suplement for a while.It's pretty common I think because the baby is sucking everything out of you, your energy, vitamins, iron...I don't know if it has anything to do but I was also anemic when i was little and had to do a blood test every week to monitor it, now my DD is also anemic not by a lot but everytime she has a check up, she turns out anemic)",

    "question": "This is my fist pregnancy. I am 24 weeks pregnant and have been told it is possible I could get preeclampsia. Everytime they have done a urine dip it has had trace amount of protein. Also, the last blood test done came back slightly anemic. My hands have been swelling so bad they past couple of days I can't get my weeding ring off. The swelling only last for a couples of hours or so, then goes back down. Yesterday and today, I have had cramps. Not like full blown period cramps, but dull ones like when you first start your period. I hate to call the doctor everytime I have a question or feel something.\u00a0\u00a0Are these cramps normal, and what are other signs that I should watch for, to help me decide when to call the doctor?",
