I brought myself a wrist support to help. I suffer from headaches that make me feel really sick. Sometimes can be caused by lack of sleep, so try having a little rest and a drink of water or squash with a bit of fruit.\u00a0\u00a0Normally helps me. I'm 32 weeks. Hope you feel better soon",

            "answer": "My doctor recommended to stay away from flexeril during my pregnancy. I have chronic back issues and took flexeril daily but stopped when I got pregnant. Might check with OB before taking anything. Also, why wouldn't you be able to be pre eclamptic at 29? I had it with my youngest daughter at 22 and my doc has been monitoring me to make sure it didn't happen again. See your OB about this and I hope you find some relief soon. Try some cold and heat a couple times a day on your wrists and see it that helps. Good luck!",

He doesn't seem to listen to.my problems. But I am also using hot patch for my shoulder pain and that's helping me. My right wrist pain is gone but my left is still same. I will buy the wrist strap for carpel tunnel. Tha k you all for suggestions.",

            "answer": "I can't stand hoe doctors either... haha jk I know it was autocorrect. I have sinus and asthma issues too. I have two air purifiers I keep running all the time at home. I take vitamin c as an anti histamine... it's also a super antimicrobial and antiinflammatory which helps with sinuses. I don't eat dairy. Maybe try some lifestyle changes to cope with your sinuses. I know it's soo difficult this time of year! Eating extra fruits and veggies calm everything down for me too. Apparently pregnancy makes your sinuses swell, the ear (not) popping drives me insane! I agree about the shoulder pain.. I used to have gall issues and that random pain seems to always be an issue with that, hydration, liver, etc. Thankyou for mentioning that about carpal tunnel during oregnancy, my right wrist has been hurting as well!",

            "answer": "Jamienvance exactly my thought, he is giving me medicines like Halloween candy. I moved to a new place this month Snr he is my new obgyn. The other ones are like 2 hrs away from where I currently live. So I don't really have an option to change the obgyn soon. My sinus is getting better.i bought a humidifier. It helps a lot to open up my nose and ears. But my shoulder blade pain could be because of gall bladder. I will call them again and ask me to check for it. Hehe @jaloveslorevi you are funny. I am sure it was the typo. Thank you all for your great responses and sharing your experience.",

    "question": "Hi there, I am 25+4 days pregnant. I went to see my doctor yesterday and didn't exactly get the service I wanted. Hope some of you can help. 3 days ago I had this severe headache and I couldn't sleep at night. So I took Tylenol at 4 am and went to bed. That helped. But I am also having this pain around my right shoulder blade, and has been going on for 6 days. On top of that I have really bad sinuses,\u00a0\u00a0humidifier doesn't help me. Also my wrist bones on both of my hands hurt a lot. So went to see the doctor yesterday, the place was so busy, had to wait for 2 hours till I talked to the doc. When I finally saw him. He checked for my sinuses and prescribed me 2 medicines. Also he prescribed me 2 shots for my migraine headache(I only got headache for one night). Also he dint ask me about my back pain and prescribed me FLEXERIL. And he walked away. Never got to talk to him about my\u00a0\u00a0wrist pain. I am still disappointed.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to take all these medicines as he didn't even listen to my problems. I checked online about preeclampsia and he side since I am 29 yo I can't have it. Please help if I should take my medicines or is there anyone having the same problem as I do.",
