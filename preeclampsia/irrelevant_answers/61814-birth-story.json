    "question": "I'm finally a mother! Might be a little late at sharing, but here it goes.Tuesday I was scheduled to do lab work to confirm if I had any issues with preeclampsia. Later the same day I got a call from my doctor letting me know that I should go to l&d that evening to be admitted for induction the following morning. The night at the hospital was long! I was hooked up to oxytocin that evening starting at 7pm. I had a few contractions here and there, but was showing no progress of dilation. My dose of pitocin was being upped every 4 hours as well. At 730am, the following morning, my doctor came in to break my water, and it was an odd experience lol. After my water broke the contractions got more intense and closer together. I planned on having a natural birth, and considered the epidural because everyone was pushing it on me, and I was in so much pain. I didn't give in yet. For 10 hours I was going through the most intense back labor but showed no progress of dilation. (I was still at 3cm) I ended up having a fever during the last hour and they decided to perform a c section on me. The thought of being cut open made me nervous, but my doctor suggested it would be good for me and the baby due to the fever I had and the little progress I've been making during labor.\u00a0\u00a0I received the epidural twice, because the first one didn't work (I could still feel my contractions)...then once I was in the surgery room I was given something that made me feel completely numb!In just 20 minutes under the knife my little girl was born! June 18th at 7pounds 15ounces and 20.5inches long. She was born with a full head of hair! She did have to spend almost 2 days in the nursery due to respiratory problems, but she's as healthy as she could be today. I'm lucky, I see her and fall in love all over again. My daughter, Rhiannon Johanna VanWinkle, is what I live for now.Thanks for being so patient mommys. I wish you all a healthy pregnancy and safe delivery. Any other questions, please feel free to comment! (:",
