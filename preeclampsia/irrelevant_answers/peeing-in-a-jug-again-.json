            "answer": "I just had to deliver my baby via c-section last Friday due to severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.. I was only 28 weeks.. if they find a lot of protein in your urine and your blood pressure is high they may start you on magnesium it's awful honestly its the worst thing I have ever gone through and now my baby girl is in the NICU ... Thankfully I was able to hold out on giving birth for them to give me two rounds of steroid shots to develop her lungs ...

I wish you the best of luck",
