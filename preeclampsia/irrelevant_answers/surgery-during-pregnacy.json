            "answer": "Actually I went through the same problem with my gallbladder not to long ago. They told me that they didn't want to do anything until after the baby was born but i had the option if I wanted to do it. I told them no. Because they would have to put me under and that in my belief isn't healthy for the baby. And so I'm now waiting until after the baby gets here to discuss the idea again",

            "answer": "You're in the window where surgery is safest. But you don't have to have the surgery to remove it yet. I had gallstones with my last pregnancy but they weren't diagnosed until after my window had passed. I suffered through some God awful gallbladder attacks that I think helped prepare me for my epidural free labor! It's really your call, but gallstones won't kill you and probably won't hurt your baby at all, so if you're worried about the risk, I'd wait until after baby is born.",
