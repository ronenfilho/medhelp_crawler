God made us the primary caretakers for a reasonAs far as the other goes, my mom was induced with pitocin with my three year old little brother then had my one year old lil sis naturally. The contractions were the same in intensity according to her. The worse was her 18+ hour labor with my 21 year old brother lolGood luck(:",

    "question": "So I've been to L&D twice now for high bp, but once I get there it goes down. I'm so swollen, I have protein in my urine, and when they did the 24 hr urine I was 7 pts off of the cutoff for preeclampsia. I am gaining a ton of water weight. Last night In the hospital my sons hr was high so today I had to do a non stress test, luckily everything looked okay. He's measuring a week ahead. So now I go back in two days and am doing another 24 hr urine collection. The doctor said if nothing comes up from this one we will induce on Wednesday to prevent my bp from getting worse. The highest its been is 189/117. But its been right around 140/90 consistently. I'm so nervous about induction everyone says the Pitocin is worse than natural contractions! And I know it sounds crazy but it doesn't feel real yet and as a ftm I'm scared I won't know what to do. When he needs to be changed, etc. Such anxiety! Oh also I was 2 cm and 50% effaced today. Just hoping he comes naturally within the next couple days. Any advice ladies!?",
