My second one was very early due to preeclampsia so i was put to sleep for it and it left an ugly scar. I am apprehensive about getting another cesearean and i would like to hear some stories about moms who have had 3 or more. How did it go? And how was it different from the rest? Thanks in advance\u00a0\u00a0 ;-)",
