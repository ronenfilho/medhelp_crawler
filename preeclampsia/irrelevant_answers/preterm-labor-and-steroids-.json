            "answer": "I found out I had that with my first daughter when I was 35 weeks. I went to labor & delivery because of contractions and they told me I wasn't in labor but my blood pressure was too high. First they put me in bed rest for an hour and a half than they put me in the deli every room and induced me. It was too dangerous to go any further in the pregnancy. After I had my daughter my blood pressure was still high and they still had me on medicine to bring my bp down and I couldn't have my baby in my room alone. I had to have someone in the room with me until I got off the medicine and I was on a liquid dietbut in the end everything worked out good.",
