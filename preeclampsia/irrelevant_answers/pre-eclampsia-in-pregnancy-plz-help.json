            "answer": "This is my 2nd pregnancy with it. As the other ladies said the most obvious signs are high bp (over 140/90 over a couple of readings at least a couple of hours apart) and high levels of protein in urine. I had upper right side abdominal pain that they kept brushing off saying it was because of my preeclamplsia, turned out my gallbladder had quit working and had to be removed in emergency surgery. Your liver is also in that area and your pancreas, ligament pain can extend pretty high, as well as after 24wks baby is big enough to get there feet up there. So there are a couple of things it could be. If it continues call your dr and I'msure he will have a feel of it and do a urine and/or blood test. I hope everything is ok, good luck.",
