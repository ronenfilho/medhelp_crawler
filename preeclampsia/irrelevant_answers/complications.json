            "answer": "Yep, I hear ya! I had preeclamplsia with my first from 28wks and thought that was bad. Didn't imagine getting it at 15wks with this one! Been in and out of hospital 3 times already, surgery at 21wks pregnant, contractions from 24wks. I'm 26wks tomorrow and dr said today that baby can come at any time now but due to growth restriction it wouldn't survive so I really need to try to hold on until 28wks. Pregnancy is really tough. But I know from my first that as soon as they are born it really all of a sudden does feel all worth it. I still look at my son and think of how much we fought to get him and what a joy he is, not how awful the pregnancy was. Wishing you all the best for the rest of your pregnancy and a safe delivery!",

    "question": "Beyond annoyed with all of the minor complications I've had since 32 weeks. I am currently 37+1, I've had preterm labor, put on bed rest and meds. Now possible preeclampsia, more bed rest. My LO has enlarged kidneys and is measuring at 8lbs 11oz. My husband and I are small people and I've put on only 28lbs this pregnancy. Oh and he was breech up until yesterday, finally head down tho. I know he's a little miracle and I am blessed, but I'm done! I'm so stressed out! I doubt any one will respond because of the lack of drama in my post, but any suggestions for relief or experience would be much appreciated. Thank you.",
