If you are going to regular checkups, the Dr will begin to monitor for fetal distress, at which point c section could be indicated, but usually with preeclampsia I believe they will try to induce labor early if baby isn't in distress, because if your body gets toxic, it can get life threatening to you as well. If you have a diagnosis of preeclampsia, you definitely want to be following Drs orders and getting to the hospital if you think anything is wrong.",

Dr is wanting to start me on steroid shots for the baby's lungs to mature faster and then do scheduled csection at 36 weeks. I'm also going to a specialist high risk Dr every 4 weeks, I'm 31 weeks now. I would like to keep the baby in to at least 37 weeks but we'll see. Good luck to you.",
