I am now at week 19 and 4days and just found out its a girl which will be my first girl as my other 2 are boys. I've been on bed rest for a while now. I understand that frustration. Just remember to put it in God's hands he is the ultimate healer. I'm also being seen at a high risk clinic with regular blood/urine/ultrasounds. I will be praying for you hunny. Big hugs!",

            "answer": "I know it doesnt help to say this but try your hardest not to worry. I have cholestasis. Which means my liver is not functioning properly. I am 31 weeks also. I am having to go see a specialist twice weekly. They do sonos and monitor his heart rate. At any point if the bile my liver is releasing into by body enters into my placenta it will kill our baby. We found out about this at 26 weeks. It is completely scary! They are more than likely taking him at 36 weeks. I am totally scared, nervous, and freaking out. Try to take your mind off of it. When I first found out I got super depressed, worrying I wont get to take my baby home. I have put my worries in God's hands though. So far he has kept the baby healthy and growing on track. We have a few more weeks to go and our babies will be born healthy :D",

    "question": "So I'm 31 weeks & 5 days. & was just released from the hospital. I went in for a check up yesterday ended up being hospitalized & diagnosed with preeclampsia :( I was there 30 hours & they sent me home on complete bed rest with no medication because not only is my blood pressure going sky high it is also bottoming out. They gave me a steroid shot to help with her lungs. I have to go to Dr once a week for a net, blood work & urine work & ultrasound . She said as soon as it starts to get worse she is sending me straight to hospital to have baby. She said the latest she will let me go is 37 weeks (may 2nd) but she doubts she let's me go that far. This is my 3rd pregnancy & I feel like I'm failing at it. I'm just scared she is not going to be ready when they take her. As of yesterdays ultrasound she only weighed 3lbs 13 oz which they said is great but that's so tiny :( I need some prayers. & advice if there is any. Thank you & sorry so long I had no where else to talk.",
