            "answer": "A csection isnt that bad. I had one with my son. I was up walking that afternoon. I thought it would be awful but it wasnt. The dr glued the incision shut and put the butterfly tape over it, so no staples. The worst part was my arm where my iv blew. I could barely move my arm. I think i will do a csection this time too. Hadnt thought about it until now.",

            "answer": "This same thing happened (is happening to me) scheduled section next Wed due to breech baby. However I had an ultrasound at the high risk unit yesterday and she is now head down so she flipped since last Thursday. I'm 38w 4 days currently and am so confused as I was all set mentally for my scheduled section. I see my OB tomorrow and she will probably cancel it now that baby is head down. My hubby is outraged as he liked knowing the schedule for delivery.",

            "answer": "I had a horrible c section experience! Im going for vbac this time and pray I wont have to go through it again. I was in the hospital for 4 days, first 36hrs I was stuck in bed (between post op recovery not going smoothly and them keeping me on bed rest longer than normal). I dont even hardly remember being able to see nor hold my son during the first 18hrs after birth.Recovery after the hospital stay was easy and not that bad. I had staples removed after 10 days. I stopped bleeding just over 2wks post partum. I never felt painful enough to have to take the meds they sent me home with, tylenol was sufficient on occassion. I was back riding horses by almost 4wks post partum.",
