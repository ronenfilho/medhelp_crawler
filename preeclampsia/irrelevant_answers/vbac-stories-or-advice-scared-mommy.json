I didnt get to hear my baby cry for the first time, feed him, hold him. I started going through depression over it. This time around I have the option of doing a vbac or c-section.\u00a0\u00a0I just really want to be awake. My epidurals failed too with my first. I hope to hear other peoples response to your question too.",
