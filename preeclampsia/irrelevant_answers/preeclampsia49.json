            "answer": "My dr is managing mine with aspirin, calcium, bp meds and a low fat diet. I had great results with this with my first, got me another 7wks before I had to deliver, and this time it was picked up at 15wks and at 24wks we're going ok. Like above said, nothing you can do to prevent it but there is a lot of things your dr can do to manage it. Good luck!",

    "question": "So spent all day in triage and everything was going good but now I gotta do the 24 hour jug again just to check for preeclampsia.... any tips on it? They did say that I'm borderline but that they'd rather double check everything and make sure. So I'm just curious what I can maybe do that would not necessarily prevent it but help keep it in check better",
