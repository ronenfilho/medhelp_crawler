            "answer": "As soon as you get back to your doctor, you will know if he is going to stick you in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor's don't fool around with this, so be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0It's true that you can raise your blood pressure just by worrying, but you have had some signs of preeclampsia for a while now.\u00a0\u00a0Especially all the swelling you have had.I really think it's time for you to take your maternity leave.\u00a0\u00a0Can you swing it or do you have to work longer?\u00a0\u00a0Taking time off now, would probably help your blood pressure and your blood sugars.I had preeclampsia with the first pregnancy and was placed in the hospital for one week in my 8th month to REST.\u00a0\u00a0My pressure's did go down, but the swelling, the headache and the fatigue continued.\u00a0\u00a0I carried the baby another 5 1/2 weeks after that.\u00a0\u00a0Once the placenta was delivered the BP started to go down slowly.\u00a0\u00a0They say it's the placenta that causes the high blood pressures and delivering the placenta is the \"cure.\"You've been go, go, go with this pregnancy, after your early surgery and it's time for you to slow down.\u00a0\u00a0You already know that, so I won't preach at you.\u00a0\u00a0Sally it won't be long until the baby is here and you will be begging for some rest, so take advantage of it now.Keep us posted about your doctor visit.\u00a0\u00a0I want to know what he says and does.Big Hugs and take care,Heather",

            "answer": "Thanks Heather.I didn't get to see the doctor today.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is still on vacation leave here.I did however get the urine test and this time there is no protein (Whew!), but there is glucose (+++), so that's not so good.\u00a0\u00a0I'll repeat the test in a couple of days anyway..... as I know it's supposed to be first morning urine....No maternity leave planned, but I'm on limited driving and no more site visits (my boss insisted after the China episode)... He wants me to make sure I have someone staying with me.... I don't but I'll tell my Filipina Mum about the episode and I know she will keep a close eye on me (she lives just in the next building).Anyway, I'm going to email doc mike my update, text the obe, and try to see the pulmonologist tomorrow (if he has clinic).... this cough / cold/ asthma, whatever it is is knocking me around a bit....",

I don't know if I am making it rise simply by being stressed about all this....Going home to Manila today.\u00a0\u00a0Will go get another urine check straight away..... and chase up my doctor... am so scared of something going wrong at this stage.... probably that will make things worse.....Guess it's normal to be worrying at this stage....",
