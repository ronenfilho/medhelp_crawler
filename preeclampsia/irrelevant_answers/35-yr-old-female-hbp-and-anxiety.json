            "answer": "For the heart rates you provide, are those resting or up and moving about?\u00a0\u00a0If resting the HR is too high at 115, and normal high at 90 minus.\u00a0\u00a0If the BP medication is a beta blocker that also lowers the HR for most of us...If you are experiencing changes since you discussed the subject with you doctor it could be a good idea to raise those questions with him/her.Given your doctor's input I don't see anything to be worried about (that alone can raise the HR and BP), but I think it is a good thing to add to your list the next time you need to see your doctor.As it has been 8 months since you had your baby I'd guess that has nothing to do with your current condition, other than the stress of dealing with a baby... I'm old and a guy, so I am going from long past experience as an observer, not a mother, when it comes to having a baby and what the after effects may be.",

            "answer": "Yuppers, your BP machine could just be picking up the skips you already know about. That is rather common and just be greatful you do not feel the skips as they happening... That can make someone really anxious (like me LOL).What does your doc say about your pressure staying up since the baby was born?\u00a0\u00a0Your body should have returned to normal by now.",

            "answer": "A study of 10 141 women in 33 countries has shown beyond a \"reasonable doubt\" that intravenous magnesium reduces the risks of eclampsia among women with pre-eclampsia.The relative risk of eclampsia was reduced by 58% and the mortality rate nearly cut in half among women receiving magnesium compared to those who receive a saline drip.The authors of the study concluded that \"magnesium sulfate is remarkably effective at reducing the risk of eclampsia.\" [The Lancet 359: 1877-90, June 1, 2002]Magnesium deficiency symptoms are numerous but includes heart arrhythmias, heart palpitations, rapid heart rate, and high blood pressure to name a few.\u00a0\u00a0Absorbable forms are magnesium include citrate, glycinate, and taurate. Magnesium oxide on the other hand is poorly absorbed; 4% as shown in one study.",

    "question": "I am a 35 yr old female, had a baby in Feb 12. She was delivered via csection due to preeclampsia. I have struggled with high blood pressure ever since. I am on labetalol 200 mg twice daily. Lately when I take my readings the irregular heartbeat symbol shows up. Not every time, but once a day. I know I have palpitations the dr told me three years ago are of no concern. Could it just be picking those up? Lately, just on the past week, my heart rate will kick up once an evening to about 115, race for a few minutes, and return to normal. But somedays my average heart rate is about 85-90 bpm all day long. Help!",
