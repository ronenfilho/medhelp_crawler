            "answer": "I am so sorry for your losses.\u00a0\u00a0I talked to my doctor today about repeated miscarriages.\u00a0\u00a0She said after 3, they can do a chromosomal analysis to see if your chromosomes have any extra carriers that may prevent sustainable pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0Also, they can check you for overclotting which can cause miscarriages too.\u00a0\u00a0This can be treated during your next pregnancy if its determined to be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Other things include looking for anatomical abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0This is where I am now.\u00a0\u00a0During my u/s she noticed that my uterus has a wierd shape which might denote a double uterus or something wrong with it\u00a0\u00a0Check with your doc about tests for clotting issues or anatomical abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

    "question": "I was pregnant with twins last year and had a miscarriage at a two months. My husband and I was told to wait a year before we tried again which we done. I became pregnant again with a single child and had another miscarriage at two months. However, this miscarriage was different. I did not have any cramping however there was light bleeding. I did not have a DNC with with either pregnancy because my doctor stated it was better to let my body remove it naturally. I was given the Rhogham in the hospital during my second miscarriage however not during the first. (Hx-my first child was premature at six months and I was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia)I have taken all of the exams, thyroids, hormone level & lupus to see if one of these could be the underlining reason why I am miscarrying. All of them were negative. My initial question is are there any more test I can take to if there is disease I may have to cause it. My doctor is recommending taking hormones. How safe is it.In addition, it has been two months since my miscarriage. I have just recieved my first menstrual cycle since the second miscarriage. I am experiencing severe clotting. They are very dark deep red and are coming out more frequently. Can you advise me?",
