            "answer": "Yeah, if it were just the swelling, I would'nt be to worried, although I typically don't have any swelling during pregnancy and even currently do not have any in my legs, feet or ankles, just my hands! I saw someone else today, so maybe that is part of why I am nervous, she does'nt really know me or my history. I am probably overeacting, just worried! they having my coming back in for another blood pressure check on monday and my regular weekley appointment on thursday.",

            "answer": "I assume they are checking your urine at each visit? Next time, ask if there is any protein in your urine. They can also do a blood test to check liver function. It was those 2 factors that told my dr that we had to deliver early. But I was also swelling very significantly, especially in my feet.",

            "answer": "I had preeclampsia............. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PROTIEN IN URINE, it IS NOT preeclampsia. you only have hypertension and swelling. During preeclampsia you start swelling well before due date. I couldnt wear my rings from 5 months. Your doctor isnt worried bc hypertension is a common thing in pregnancies, as is swelling. Going to the ER isnt going to help AT ALL, esp if your hypertension isnt life treatening. They might put you on bedrest or send you home. The doctors dont go by what may be running through your mind but go by what proof they have of anything indicating a serious problem...... and preeclampsia diagnos is only going to happen if you have pain under right rib and protien. Have i summed it up for you??? If so ask any more ? that you may have.",

    "question": "I went to the Dr for check-up today (I will be 35 weeks tomorrow) and was told that my blood pressure was pretty high 142/95, they had my lay of my left side for a while and it did go down some. When I got home I looked up high blood pressure during pregnancy since this has never been a problem for me with any of my previous pregnancies (this is baby #4 for me) and it was talking about preeclampsia after reading the warning signs, i am a little freaked out, besides the high blood pressure I have been having sever headaches, abdominal pain (although, we think that this is partly acid reflux and a possible herniated asophogus), i have had a lot of nausea and vomiting for about 2 weeks, and my eyes have seemed to be getting worse. i also noticed last night that my ring was getting a little tight on my finger and switched it to my pinky and I forgot to mention it to the Dr, but there is swelling in my hands as well. all the symptoms are making really nervous for preeclampsia, with the exception that i lost weight this week and one of the signs can be weight gain. am I over reacting or do I have reason to be worried? and one who has advice or has been through this would be appreciated!",
