            "answer": "Yep that would be me :-)I developed pre eclampsia, had a C sect at 37 wks, because at 36 wks the amnio showed questionable lung maturity.I developed post partum cardiomyopathy (enlarged floppy heart muscle) with congestive heart failure and then a pulmonary embolism.\u00a0\u00a0This with my third child 2 yrs ago on Monday 5th NOv.Okay, its important that you monitor your weight, after you wake up, after peeing, gen better without clothing or the same amt of clothing every day, so you can be sure its the weight changing that you notice, not the amt of clothing you wear.\u00a0\u00a0You must report any weight gain of between 3-5 lbs or more.\u00a0\u00a0Are you nursing?\u00a0\u00a0If so that will make it a bit tricker to monitor your weight changes, but bottom line, its important to do.\u00a0\u00a0They also had me record my BP and pulse rate.\u00a0\u00a0I had to do this for mths.In order to feel okay, you\u00a0\u00a0need to eat and drink, but it sounds like you need guidance on that.\u00a0\u00a0They gave me a bunch of info from the CHF clinic I attend and I could call the CHF nurse if I had any questions.\u00a0\u00a0Your weakness could be related to the CHF, afterall your heart is not functioning as well as it could be right now. Did anyone do an echocardiogram?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what is your Ejection Fraction (EF?) its a percentage number that should be over 50% but closer to 65 or so.\u00a0\u00a0Over 50% is considered low normal.\u00a0\u00a0You need to avoid canned foods with added sodium, esp soups etc.\u00a0\u00a0I never cook with salt, so that was easy for me, but the canned and boxed food and restaurant food is harder to predict.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously fries etc and anything like that is off limits for now.\u00a0\u00a0Your weakness is also potentially related to a low potassium esp if you recently were on lasix, or anemia post delivery.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have someone do a thorough blood work up and have your adrenal function assessed too.I was given some pretty dismal stats initially, but I chose to look at them just as numbers, not as absolutes and I never allowed myself to focus on the less desirable outcomes which are transplant list type stuff.\u00a0\u00a0So about a third of people develop severe probs and need transplants or have heart attacks, about a third of people have some residual damage like leaky valves, lower end of normal ejection fraction etc, and about a third have no residual probs.\u00a0\u00a0I had way too many years of planned nagging for my hubby, to consider being in anything but the no residual probs category :-).\u00a0\u00a0I truthfully have ended up with a minor leak in one of my valves and some heart rhythm probs, but for the most part I have to say 2 yrs on I am doing fairly well.\u00a0\u00a0I did however get that PE which may have been related to the cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\u00a0 I still take lasix and have to monitor my weight, I can put on 5 lbs over night if I eat salty food, I still also take meds for my heart.\u00a0\u00a0That I can handle no prob, but I do have to be proactive about my bloodwork and any potentially heart related probs.\u00a0\u00a0They indicated to me that they will probably keep me under cardiology follow up for at least another 3 yrs (that would be 5yrs total).You do need to take any heart issues seriously and follow up with your cardiologists office when scheduled.\u00a0\u00a0So have a fairly low tolerance for checking up on any changes in your health status, meaning things like feeling weak.\u00a0\u00a0But it may end up being nothing and worry can certainly mimic heart symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would be asking for some lasix to have on hand, to manage any swelling, but do not get obssessed by it, being pg will markedly aggravate any type of CHF, so you will find nothing will change as quickly now you are not pg.Also if you are questioning of anything you are told, then seek a second opinion, anyone should be happy for you to do this.I am happy to answer any Q's you have.\u00a0\u00a0Post here in reply and I can share an email addy with you if it would help any.I hope this is not too rambly.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to ask any Q's you have, I can so relate as to how worried you are, esp with the responsibility of a new baby to cope with along with your health issues.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of women who get this type of thing, but its not considered common at all and lots do not talk about it.Huge hugs, I hope this has helped some.\u00a0\u00a0I promise it will get better.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, how is your baby?Fiona, Colorado",

            "answer": "hey thanx for the info. My daughter is very good & healthy, thanx. They didnt tell me exactly what my E.F. is, so I'm not sure. They just said I'm not pumping as tight as I should be. I'm not nursing. I wasn't able to b/c of all of the problems I had & I had to be in I.C.U. So, to make sure I understand you right, about 1/3 of women with this same diagnosis (due to pregnancy) need a transplant? That's a pretty high number. The docs are telling me that almost all of their patients who go through it, heal up on their own & survive. I had no idea that 1/3 need transplants! I have had 2 echo's done. As I explained, I don't know the exact E.F. When he released me, he said he wants to do another echo in 4-6 wks to see where my heart is at then. I received lasix at the hospital, and lost 6 liters of water, but they didn't give me any to take home. I am no longer swollen, but I have not been using a scale to weigh myself everyday. That's probably something I should get. I have however, been keeping close track of my BP. This seems to be ruling my life right now, it's very scary. I appreciate your advice. It's nice to have someone to talk to about this, because I feel like I'm the only person in the world going through this. Should I be concerned that I may need a transplant? I'm so afraid of dying and leaving my newborn baby behind. After all, I am 19 myself. This is the hardest thing I've ever been through. My doc said if I start having shortness of breath & begin to swell up again to get to the E.R. I've been out of the hospital 5 days and I am not swelling yet, & seem to be feeling better. So, after 2 yrs, you still have CHF? Has your heart healed any since the delivery? Thank you so much for everything. Talk to you soon.",

            "answer": "Transplant comes up about a third of the time for women with heart failure probs during and post pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0A third do fine, with some residual probs. that need tracking and a a final third do just great, never effects them long term at all.\u00a0\u00a0As tempting as it is to focus on the third that do not do great initially, its probably wasted time worrying about yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Personally I chose to the let the Drs worry for me, if they were worried (at one time a cardiologist admitted me, not for heart probs but because my lungs would not function.\u00a0\u00a0Thats the way I am ,willing to let go what I can control but not necessarily worry too much about the other stuff either.My heat has healed someeone during the 2 yrs., my EF was 40-45^% and has risen to 53-55% , but had been at 55-60%.\u00a0\u00a0So a touch of a drop along with some shortness of breath lead to a reduction in movement.I do truly need to get some sleep, out baby is up with tooth pain, 3 molars coming in.I will post tmmorrow.\\Fiona",

            "answer": "Okay, remember those stats are just NUMBERS, not something that is absolute, which means MOST women fall into the category of doing just fine or having just a few issues leftover like me. Very FEW women have heart attacks or could end up on the transplant list.\u00a0\u00a0 You are unlikely to fall into the category of having really serious problems mostly because its been picked up and you are being treated for the condition.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure being so young will be hugely in your favor!\u00a0\u00a0This is a serious condition but its very likely to resolve, as mine did and many other women in the same position.Make sure you get enough of what you need in order to heal, that is food, fluid, a place to call home and be secure, plus rest, rest, rest -\u00a0\u00a0when you feel tired try to at least rest on a bed or couch.\u00a0\u00a0Its not worth exhausting yourself if the washing is piling up, its okay, its hard enough being a new Mom, let alone adding this to the mix.\u00a0\u00a0Take it a day at a time and do NOT worry so much about whether you will be here or not, its normal to worry about that with a new baby, but you do not need to add to that by worrying about your heart too. The Drs are helping you with that, let it go.My heart function improved over a period of about 18mths or so, but I got better much quicker in the first 9 mths or so, than after that, then I have just had this hiccup recently.\u00a0\u00a0 However I am twice you age :-)\u00a0\u00a0I do not have CHF right now, my EF is on the low end of normal and in general I do not swell too much but I do have other issues outside of this.Have you sought out a new Moms support group?\u00a0\u00a0If not contact your hospital social services and ask them to give you the information.\u00a0\u00a0You can do this by ph. This will be a lifeline for you as you adjust, plus it will help refocus on the goodness in your life.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes you will find a Moms Club in your area, or a MOPs club.\u00a0\u00a0Google them and find your local clubs.I am so sorry you are dealing with this, but I promise it will improve.\u00a0\u00a0You are so not alone, it is tough to find people who have what you have, because typically its relatively rare, but thats not to say you are alone.\u00a0\u00a0For a start I am here and can help answer your Q's.\u00a0\u00a0Please do not panic about the numbers, that is why the physicians tend not to tell people, you have enough to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0If they were really concerned, you would still be in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0You should know your EF though, thats a useful number to have for any medical info.Best wishes.\u00a0\u00a0I do lurk here so post away and ask any Q's you have.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for any clarification you need.Fiona - Mom to three ages 23mths, 4y and 7yo.",

I can't enjoy my beautiful new baby girl, or my life, due to my worries about this. I seem to be getting better, I'm not retaining water and my blood pressure meds are keeping my blood pressure low. I do have a cardiologist. I'm supposed to check in with him on the 26th. I'm afraid I will die in the middle of the night, so every night I lay up late scared to sleep. Would I have signs ahead of time that I was going back into CHF? Or would it hit me out of nowhere in the middle of the night? My symptoms seem to be getting better but the fear about it is driving me crazy. What is a healthy amount of sodium to take in? Thanks, I will visit that sight. I appreciate the help.",

    "question": "ill try to make this one as short as possible. at 35 wks of pregnancy I had to get an emergency c-section due to preeclampsia. The preeclampsia caused me to retain a lot of water, which caused me to get pneumonia and CHF. They had to give me lasix due to my water retention & I lost 6 liters of excess water in one night! Docs put me on blood pressure meds & sent me home after a week. I am on a low sodium diet, but I have not been eating much because everything has sodium in it & I am afraid that I'll take in too much and begin to swell up again. I'm not quite sure how much is too much.. I feel very weak, not sure if its b/c I'm not sure what I can eat now, or if its due to my CHF. My docs said they think that with time & if I take my lisenoprol & lopresser twice daily, they believe my heart will heal itself. I'm praying that that is what happens. Does anyone know of a situation similar to this, where preeclampsia leads into CHF? Docs said most women who develop it from pregnancy pull out of it after a few months, but I'm still very nervous. Should I be concerned for my life? What can I do to help heal my heart? And how much sodium is harmful to the recovery of my heart?? If anyone has answers please let me know. thanx",
