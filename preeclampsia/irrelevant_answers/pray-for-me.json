            "answer": "Proteinuria can be a sign of some scary complications - but remember that preeclampsia and high blood pressure affect you much more than they affect your baby. They are actually fairly common complications that women deal with every day, and the vast majority of their babies are born on time and healthy. Try to take it easy, do some gentle exercise but take plenty of breaks to put your feet up, drink plenty of water. Your doctor will give you more information but try not to let it stress you out too much until you have more test results and some confirmation. The likelihood is very very high that everything will turn out just fine in the end, though you may spend more time under observation than you'd like.",
