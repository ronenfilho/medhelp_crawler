    "question": "For those who had to go thru this.. when were you told you had it? My cousin was told around 5 months...i am 6 months and just had an appt yesterday and was told I was fine. I guess I'm just worrying because I don't eat very well (salt addiction) and I know you can have high blood pressure at any time during ur pregnancy.. also because I really don't want to be induced because of preeclampsia. ;(",
