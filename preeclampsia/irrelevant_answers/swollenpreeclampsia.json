            "answer": "If it is hot where you live its probably nothing more than just swelling. Ive had the same problem for a few months now, extreme swelling in my legs, feet and hands. It was painful and nothing helped it. I would ask my dr about it at every appointment, because like you everyone made me worry about preclampsia. He reassured me each that it was not, no protein in my urine and my blood pressure was fine. I am now 37 weeks and up until last week I to was working full time. Now that I am no longer working my swelling has almost completely gone away. Its nice to see my ankles again :)",
