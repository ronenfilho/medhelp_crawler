I was given picotin after my labour had already started and it made my contractions stronger and faster to the point where i wasnt getting a break in between them. But it made my labour go quickly. Im not sure what its like to be given the meds before labour starts but it will just start your labour off strong. Good luck ladies, youll meet your babes soon!",
