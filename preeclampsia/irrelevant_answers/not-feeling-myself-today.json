    "question": "I feel horrible today! I woke up throughout the night with horrible rib pain that hurts when I breathe in. I still have it and it is 2:30 pm. I have had heartburn since yesterday morning and it's still here, along with a headache that won't go away.. my stomach and back hurt too. Idk what is going on :( I see my dr Wed so I am trying to hold off until then.. I have had high blood pressure and a lot of swelling so idk if the pains are related to preeclampsia or what. Any advice is appreciated. thanksOh, I am 33 weeks and 2 days.",
