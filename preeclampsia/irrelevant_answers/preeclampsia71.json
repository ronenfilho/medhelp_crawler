    "question": "Hi everyone..Im 21 years old, ftm, 31+1 weeks pregnant. I'm in the hospital for the second time in a week. I have been diagnosed with preeclampsia. I'm really scared! All my blood tests have come back good and my little baby girl is doing great. But my blood pressure won't go down. The doctor says that if it doesn't go down she needs to come out early..and that really scares me. Has this happened to anyone else? They gave me medicine last week to help her lungs develop faster..I just hope she will be ok if she has to come out soon.",
