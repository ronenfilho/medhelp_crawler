    "question": "I'm 37 weeks today and a few days ago was told that I had gestational hypertension. They were able to get my blood pressure down to allow me to go home but said I needed to come back to do more tests to monitor for preeclampsia. Because I'm now 37 weeks if my blood pressure is high again today they said they will induce me. I'm so so nervous. Has this happened to anyone else?",
