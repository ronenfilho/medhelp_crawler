            "answer": "It's not your fault at all!! I developed preeclampsia with my first pregnancy which is common and I'm again developing or showing signs of it again. There is no control over it and it either happens or doesn't. I've had high blood pressure since 25 weeks and increased swelling over the last 4 weeks (being very bad this week). I've stayed super active, eating healthy and drink like 3L or more of water each day. I've got traces of protein in my urine and if it gets worse I'll be induced. Watch if you get blurred vision/see stars/get bad headaches. I have these occasionally at the moment and I'm just being monitored. I'll probably be induced early like last time :)",

    "question": "I had got carpal tunnel at 27wks and my hand and feet swelling started around the same time and its very painful so my dr put me on pain meds and and wrist braces and lowered my sodium intake and upped my water intake, i thought i was doing everything right this pregnancy with eating healthy and being active so when i went to my 33wk appt today my blood pressure was very high and the combo of the swelling and carpal tunnel makes me high risk for preeclampsia which my dr did blood work and urine tests and she told me the opinions of what could happen which 1 i would be induced asap depending on how bad the preeclampsia or 2 csection because he is breeched. I am very scared because my 6 and 8yrs old sons were very easy very smooth pregnancy and i dont understand what i am doing wrong this time if i am doing everything right",
