This time developed it at 15wks was on aspirin calcium and bp meds but still went into preterm labour at 27wks so bedrest and different bp meds from 27wks. Now almost 32wks and hoping to make it to my csection at 36wks. It's a really tough pregnancy but at least you are so close to full term now. Wishing you and bub lots of luck!",
