            "answer": "I had pregnancy hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't turn into preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Preeclampsia has different symptoms associated with it besides the obvious high blood pressure---\u00a0\u00a0swelling (push into your skin and see if it dimples) but also protein in urine is a big one.I knew when my blood pressure was high because you get a headache, see floaty things and get a little dizzy.so, just the swelling isn't terribly concerning especially if you have never had any blood pressure issues in pregnancy but if anything else is going on, definitely tell your doctor with a call.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, talk to your doctor when you next see him or her.elevate your feet and cut down on all salt as this helps with swelling as well as drinking lots of water.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",
