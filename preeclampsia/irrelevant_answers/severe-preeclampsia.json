            "answer": "It will be ok. My first came unexpectedly at 31 weeks. Went in for a routine appointment and found out my blood pressure was so high that they had to take baby right away. My little one came out 2lbs 4ounces. She had to stay in hospital for 4 weeks and me \tin hospital for 2 weeks because couldn't get blood pressure to stay stable. When doc told me me and baby could have died I was thankful that 4 weeks of time was all I had to give up to get my baby home. I pray your experience is different but no matter what happens it will be ok.",
