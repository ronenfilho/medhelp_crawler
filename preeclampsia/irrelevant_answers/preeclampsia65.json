            "answer": "The cramping comes from the extra blood flow that we have during pregnancy on top of hormones that relax and tense muscles sporadically. With pre ecalmpsia you need to watch for extra swelling...I started having numbness in my hands a few weeks ago and the doctor said its just all the extra blood. They test your urine at most of your doctors visits looking for the protein that causes the ecampsia. If you notice you have frequent headaches high blood pressure and lots of swelling it may be but muscles cramping is usually just your hormones causing trouble",
