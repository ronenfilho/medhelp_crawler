            "answer": "Damn!! That's way too high period. My doctor is confused about my Blood sugar lvls... one day they are fine the next over 200. I'm actually surprised you haven't gained more than 24lbs. I have to check my sugar 4 or more times a day. That's not really that bad.... just a finger *****.\u00a0\u00a0They even admitted into the hospital me last wk to get my sugar lvls under control. I don't know how much GD and preeclamsia are going to effect each other, but I don't think it will make it worse. I also don't think you will be put on bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0I do however think your doctor will probably want you delivered around 35wks if you can make it that long. GD if not under control becomes dangerous for you and the baby. My doctor doesn't like to see anything over 200 EVER. You should change the way you eat. It helps tremendously..... usually. Cut out carbs and sugar as much as possible. Drink lots and lots and lots and lots of water. The way the doctors explained it to me when your Sugar gets too high and bounces too much it can make your little ones sick too. I'm not trying to scare you. But it is a very serious thing. You can message me on myspace if you want to talk more :)",
