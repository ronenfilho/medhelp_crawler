Pre eclampsia is where there is protein in your urine, your bp is high (150/90 or higher), it can cause swelling in your fave, ankles, rapid weight gain, headaches. Having high blood pressure is usually controlled with a medicine and they watch you to make sure baby is growing correctly.",

            "answer": "Your doctor will keep an eye on you and baby. Most likely if it goes up a little higher, they will give you a bed to keep it in check. They may also have you collect your urine for 24 hours to get a basis for any protein your body may make (if any- if you are not a diabetic or normally have high bp, you probably don't have protein in your urine), but they will take that test sample to compare if protein should show up later. Having a slightly higher bp can happen - lots going on with your body, doesn't mean you become pre eclamptic.",
