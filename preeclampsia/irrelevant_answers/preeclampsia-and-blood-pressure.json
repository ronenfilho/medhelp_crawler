            "answer": "Hello, sorry to hear you're going through this, I know the fear abd anxiety way too well. I developed it at 28wks with my first. They managed it with bp meds and 3 hospital visits and got us to 35wks before I delivered via csection and it was a long hard 7wks. We were told we would be very unlucky to get it again so when our son was 10mths old we decided to take our chances. We used the same ob and from 6wks he put me on aspirin and calcium in hope I would grow a bettet placenta and avoid it this time, but, as rare as it is to develop it early, I was terrified to notice swelling after seeing the familiar white spots one night and my dr found I had developed it again at 15wks this time. Back then we never thought we would make it to 24wks and the dr even went through the milestones and statistics of survival for baby at each week. But with bp meds we were managing the symptoms great accept for the 5 hospital admissions (so far) to get it under control. Then at 27wks my body decided it had had enough and went into preterm labour. It was pretty scary but they stopped it 3 times and after 2wks I was allowed home on bedrest. I'm now 30wks and dr says it could be days or weeks but if my body does last the distance he will not let me go past 36wks. My dr has since told me no more babies, my body just can't do it especially now I've had it twice because of the liver and kidney damage, and I ont be able to ever use oestrogen based contraceptives again as they will effect my blood pressure even tho when not pregnant I've never had hypertension issues. I've also since learnt that we'd have a 90% chance of it happening again so two is enough for me. However, this is all because of how early I've developed it. Apparently the later you develop it the better the outcomes and the less risk you are of having it again. I'm sure you're dr's talked you through all that tho. I will keep my fingers crossed for a smooth pregnancy for you! Good luck x",

    "question": "Hey Ladies, preggo with baby number two. My oldest will be nine in January, so it's been a few years to say the least. I was overdue with a preeclampsia diagnosis at the end of my pregnancy and was induced. While the doctors and I speculate it was caused by being overdue there's always risk in your second if you had it in your first. As a second time mom I find myself more nervous because I know just how precious and valuable my babies are to me. In all of my appointments up until the last one I've been extremely nervous to hear heart beat and know baby is healthy. My blood pressure was sky high, she retook it at the end of my appointment and it was back to normal.... But told me to keep an eye on it. I bought a blood pressure cuff and have taken it every night since, a few times it was high but most of time it's in the perfectly healthy range. Anyone else deal with any of this? Would love some stories, the good and the bad... I'm not one to self diagnose and panic really looking for true experiences and support, thanks!!",
