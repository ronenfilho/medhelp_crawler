    "question": "HiJust saw my doctor today for a routine check up as I am 29 weeks pregnant.I have had swelling in my hands, feet and face for a few weeks now (to be expected) but today the doctor said my blood pressure was a bit high and there was a small amount of protein in my urine. She asked me to take is easy for the weekend and come back on Monday to check\u00a0\u00a0both urine and blood pressure again. Is there a chance that they might be normal on Monday and this is not preeclampsia or am I just getting my hopes up?",
