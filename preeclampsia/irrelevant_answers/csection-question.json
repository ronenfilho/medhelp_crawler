I was high risk last time around and this time I'm considered as having a normal pregnancy but due to a fibroid being directly in the baby's escape route, i have to get another c section.\u00a0\u00a0I had such a lovely experience the first time around (despite the hours of labor before the dr decided on a cesarean) that I'm looking forward to this process.I think all will go well with your c section and especially because you were high risk the first time around, so, that definitely means the doctor's will ensure that every step in your delivery process is well thought out. This time around doctors will be even more prepared than they were the first time around. Best wishes and congrats on baby...you'll have a breezy and extra safe delivery.",

            "answer": "I had a cesarean August 5, 2013. It was solely because of placenta previa and absolutely not what I wanted, but it was the safest way for me and my daughter. I am now 7 weeks pregnant and have just moved to another state, so I was able to really search around for a good VBAC doctor. I haven't met with him just yet, but the nurse I met with was very reassuring on how many women really do have VBACs here with this doctor. I still have many questions to ask him personally, but it looks very possible right. However, the chance of me having placenta previa again is much higher than that of me having it in the first pregnancy (which was 1%), so you never know what will happen the further along you get. You might want to check around and see if other doctors agree with your current doctor or not. I found this blog to have extremely helpful. It is about questions to ask when considering VBAC.http://walkingwithdancers.blogspot.com/2013/10/questions-to-ask-provider-when-hoping.html?m=1I hope that everything works out for you and that, in the end, you come home safely with a healthy baby!",
