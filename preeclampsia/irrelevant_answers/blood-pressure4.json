            "answer": "You could be getting hypertension which is what I had for my first. But that was at the end of my pregnancy weeks 39/40. They took my BP at week 39 and it was high but just logged it. (Not too high to be concerning at the time) at week 40 they took it again and it was just slightly higher so they made me run through the ritual of preeclampsia test. They told me I had hypertension and\u00a0\u00a0that they wanted to induce me the next day. I had them give me a sweep to see if I could get natural labor going which worked because I was back that night in labor.Try to relax. I know that's hard to say but if your test came back fine then I'm sure you're fine. No need to worry until the next time they take your BP.",

    "question": "Went to my appointment and my bp was 143/89 which is high for me. My readings up until now have been normal. Can't remember if there was protein in my urine or not, but I was sent to the hospital for bloodwork, urine sample, and NST. They also took 3 different bp readings during my NST. Everything ended up coming back fine and they did not find any protein in my urine, but not I am concerned about my bp and if I am getting preeclampsia. Anyone ever had something like this?",
