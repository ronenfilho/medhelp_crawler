            "answer": "I had one high BP at my 32 week appointment and 2 more high blood pressures at my 39 week appointment and they induced me that day. And by high, I mean barely over 140/90 each time. Of course once they started the induction all of my BPs were perfect and around 115/75... I too am surprised your doctor hasn't already induced you if your BP is that high regularly.",

I'm 35 weeks now and today when I saw the high risk doctor it was 154/100. He immediately sent me to the ob to have blood work done and for the ob to assess me. Now we wait for the results to come back tomorrow and they will decide whether to induce me now or if it's safe to monitor me until I hit 37 weeks and induce me then. However he told me if I developed bad headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, saw spots, had ringing in my ears or started vomiting not to wait to go to the hospital immediately. Hoping they find a resolution for you.",

I've been in the er for it and the doctor there was very concerned. I don't have preeclampsia. For moms out there who were induced for hypertension how high did it get? How long was it that high?
