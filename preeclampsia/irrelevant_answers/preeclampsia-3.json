            "answer": "Preeclampsia is a serious condition of pregnancy, and can be particularly dangerous because many of the signs are silent while some symptoms resemble \u201cnormal\u201d effects of pregnancy on your body. Many women suffering from preeclampsia don\u2019t feel sick, and may be surprised or become frustrated when they are admitted to the hospital or prescribed bed rest since they still feel well.High blood pressure is an important sign of preeclampsia. The disease is sometimes referred to as a silent killer because most people can\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d their blood pressure going up. As a result, patient awareness of the warning signs is one of the most important tools we have to successfully help women receive the care they need. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with signs and symptoms included here to empower yourself and/or others during pregnancy.What you can do...Proper prenatal care is essential so don\u2019t miss your appointments. Weighing in, checking your blood pressure and testing your urine for protein, each important for detecting preeclampsia, should take place at every prenatal visit. Do not be afraid to question your caregiver if any of these tests are omitted.A good prenatal diet full of vitamins, minerals and the basic food groups are important for any pregnancy, as is reducing consumption of processed foods, refined sugars and caffeine. Eliminating alcohol and any medication not prescribed by a physician is essential. Report all medications prescribed by other doctors to your prenatal care provider so that these products can be checked regarding their safe use during pregnancy. Speak with your health care professional before taking any nutritional supplement \u2013 herbal or otherwise. Although there is no evidence that these healthy behaviors and choices impact preeclampsia, they do optimize your health for the best pregnancy possible.Preeclamsia.org",

            "answer": "I had it severely with my first. Best way to explain it is a didn't grow a very good placenta so when baby started taking my nutrients it started putting pressure on my liver which released enzymes my kidneys couldn't filter which leaked proteins and my blood pressure went up. Baby was ok but eventually stopped growing and as my placenta and liver burnt out I had to have a csection. My dr prescribed aspirin, calcium and blood pressuee tablets to slow it down but once it starts you can't stop it, just manage it, that's why its so important to catch it early.",
