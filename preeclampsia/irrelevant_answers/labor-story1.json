    "question": "I was told my baby was not growing the way he should have been. Went to the ER a few days later then they told me I had Miled preeclampsia. Then two days later my midwife and I were deciding on a date to induce me we decided the 20th would be good. She stepped out of the room for a few minutes came back and told me the plan was changing and I was to be induced that day (12/11) soo I went home got a few things and went back. I got there and they started my induction! I really wanted to go natural but all of the nurses kept telling me I wasn't in active labor and I would probably not deliver until (12/13) I was dialed to a 5 but the monitor was not picking up my contractions. Soo I got the epidural (it only worked in my right leg I could feel everything else) they broke my water and tried to fix my epidural I was still at a 5 thenn an hour later the pain was terrible so the doctor came and checked me. I was at a ten but they didn't think I was ready to push. But I insisted I atleast try. I pushed once the doc shook her head saying it wasn't time yet cause he was not low enough I pushed a second time then they started to get things ready haha 3 sets of pushes and my beautiful baby boy Armani was born!! 4 pounds 6 ounces and\u00a0\u00a018 inches long! The most amazing thing that ever happened to me!! I only needed two stiches!",
