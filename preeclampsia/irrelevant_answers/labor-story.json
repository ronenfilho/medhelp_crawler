    "question": "SORRY ITS SO LONG!!!On April 4th I went to labor and delivery for having contractions, but they were to irregular. I was 38 weeks and 4 days.. they started monitoring me and my bp was crazy all over and i was super dizzy and blured vision and a head ache. They decided to induce me over preeclampsia symptons. At 1:45am april 5th i started the pill that goes by my cervix since i was half a cm dilated and barely thinned at all!! That morning they let me eat and shower then another pill. Finally it started working but very slowly. At 11pm i was 3cm and they started Pitocin and gave me a epidural since my contractions were 3 to 4 min apart before even getting my medicine. By 12:50am on April 6th my water broke. At 8am i was 9cm and 90% effaced, they told me if it didn't change in a few hours i would get a c sectionm, at 10 they checked and yay i was there. I tried pushing but my body wasn't doing enough with the epidural so i had to let it start wearing off. I started pushing about 12:45pm and i welcomed my baby boy into this world at 2:30pm on April 6th weighing 8.10 and 21 3/4in. When he came out the cord was around his neck. Took 17 min to stabalize him and it was the longest 17 min of my life. I lost ALOT of blood and got super sick. We both were anemic but he was only slightly. I am so blessed to have such a amazing baby and glad he was okay!",
