            "answer": "I had it in my first pregnancy and had to end up delivering at 35 weeks. I'm currently 27 weeks with my second and so far my blood pressure has been good so far but my Dr said he will monitor it when I get into my 30 weeks. I did however just found out I have GD with this pregnancy so I'm hoping I don't get preeclampsia on top of that! I wish you the best of luck it's a scary deal but I would just suggest you definitely rest as much as possible and don't over do it! Good luck!",
