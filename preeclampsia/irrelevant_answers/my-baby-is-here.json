I had to have a c-section due to my BP issue turning into preeclampsia and the fact that they said he was weighing 9lbs 11ozs. He came out weighing 8lbs 12ozs and was 21in long. He has a head full of brown and blond hair and is just simply prefect. Baby and I are doing great!!!! Good Luck to all you Mommies!!!!",
