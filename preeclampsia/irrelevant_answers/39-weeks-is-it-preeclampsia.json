            "answer": "NO!\u00a0\u00a0You are NOT overreacting.She NEEDS to let her doctor know IMMEDIATELY.\u00a0\u00a0Vision problems along with swelling can be a sign that her BP is high which may also signal preeclampisa.\u00a0\u00a0Both conditions can be life-threating so she MUST let her doctor know.\u00a0\u00a0Her history is also concerning (the fact she has already had high BP during this pregnancy) but what is important at this point is she is experiencing symptoms that warrant IMMEDIATE investigation .\u00a0\u00a0Even if he BP was fine for the last 4 months of her appointments, that is not an indicator of what is going on now.Your sister feeling better after eating a Popsicle does not mean she has gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes will not cause sudden onset swelling.",
