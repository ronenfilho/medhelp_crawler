            "answer": "The Down syndrome test has a high risk for false positives/negatives and the mistake happens a lot! It his is just coming from someone who works in healthcare... But idk about you, but I know I would rather be safe than sorry especially since preeclampsia can be dangerous for your baby! I get its frustrating but it's always better to test twice and be sure than to test once and wonder... But as far as the Down syndrome test, that does happen quite frequently. At our clinic we do let patients know that though before the test is done!",

            "answer": "And also, the nurses just relay the information that is printed on your charts from the doctor... Most \"nurses\" at clinics are usually LPNs or CMA's and have to work under direction of a doctor. It is a hard job and frustrating when patients blame the nurses. They're just told to relay the message and always get pooped on for it. Just know it's not their fault!",

    "question": "So I was told Monday over the phone that I had mild preeclampsia after a bunch of testing. I had my appointment today and was told I didn't even have it. Everything was prefect and good. Dont get me Worng I'm pleased that I'm okay and my baby is too. The issue is this makes 2 times I've got called and told false information the first time it happened I was told I tested high risk for down syndrome, then now I have preeclampsia. Something so serious as the 2 are wouldn't you think they would know for sure before calling with bad news??? I'm almost 35 weeks it's to late to change doctors now. I like my doc but not so much the nurses who call me!! Sorry for ranting but this is uncalled for.",
