            "answer": "My pregnancy started out the same as yours and I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at 14 weeks, baby also is suffering from iugr (intrauterine growth restriction diagnosed @ 24wks). My swelling depends on how active I have been and slight swelling at the end of the day is a normal pregnancy system. I have been on modified bed rest since 27 weeks and now 32 weeks and still neg for preeclampsia. Rest as much as possible, my dr told me if it is not essential to sustain a normal lifestyle then do not do it (ie sweeping, mopping, shopping, etc). Drink lots of water and make sure you are eating a healthy diet. I wish you the best of luck!",

    "question": "Hi ladies, im currently 17 weeks pregnant and was diagnosed with high blood pressure a month ago after going to the doctors with severe migraines that lasted for 3 weeks! I had no swelling or protein in my urine when I was last tested but have just noticed swelling in my ankles last night its not alot but I have been having these occasional headaches aldo. My questions is for any one who's had pre eclampsia how much swelling did you get? I know you generally dont get pre eclampsia until after week 20 onwards but im just concerned because I already have pregnancy induced high blood pressure.",
