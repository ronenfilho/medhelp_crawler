            "answer": "Hi Kailes and welcome....Have you been to your regular PCP for any of these symptoms? I would start there and see what they say. Your symptoms do sound neurological and considering the family history, I wouldn't just ignore it.There are many things that mimic MS,.....and it requires a lot of blood work and testing to rule out or rule in MS. Try not to worry yourself, and just get an appointment to go over your symptoms, your PCP will send you to a neurologist if they feel it necessary.Merry Christmas!",

I have not been to my regular dr yet. I guess I have just been putting it off. I just assumed since the urgent care dr said the ct scan looked good I was in the clear. But the symptoms have gotten more frequent and not gone away like I thought. I do have an appt w the eye dr jan. 18th though.",

            "answer": "Demyelinating lesions, one of the hallmark symptoms of MS really don't show up on CT.\u00a0\u00a0It really requires an MRI to see them. So your Dr or a Neirologist can prescribe that.\u00a0\u00a0As far as seeing an eye doctor, optometrists are fine for glasses, but if you have any issue that might be related to a disease of the eyes, you really need to see an ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0May of us on the forum have had Optic Neuritis, and in that case, we may have vision issues that can not be corrected with glasses, and optometrists are not really trained to deal with this kind of neurovision issue.Bob",

    "question": "Ok...so I am just so confused?!I am a 26 year old girl. I have always been so healthy. I never get sick. I've had two stomach viruses;once when I was 23 and the other at 9. I have psoriasis and I had preeclampsia in my first pregnancy. (I have two kids). I have two Aunts with ms.(My dads sisters) One who was diagnosed in her early 30s. She's now about 60 and in a wheelchair. The other was diagnosed in her late 40s.I have never really thought about having ms...but over the summer I had some points where I was very dizzy-felt like the room was spinning. Probably a good 10. Then around Thanksgiving I had some weird sensations in my left arm. Its so hard to explain. Almost like it was heavy and hard to move. It does tingle and get numb but only when I take a hot bath. I also get these pains in my fingers and hand and both arms...more in the left. They kind of feel like its in the muscle but under the skin. I get burning sensations...just all sorts of weird feelings...they have not gone away since then...somedays its worse. It doesn't really affect me other than the fact that I'm like well that's kind annoying/uncomfortable and weird. I went to urgent care a few weeks ago. Told them my symptoms and she did a head ct scan. Said everything looked normal. I have lots of headaches too. I told her that. She took blood and everything was fine. I had a uti...that was it. She said it was probably viral...and prescribed be phenergan for the dizziness. I never had it filled. I'm not looking for meds :/. I honestly don't know what to think or do next. My left eye is blurry for distances. I normally have perfect vision but did have an astignatism when I was young but it corrected itself and has been good until recently. My eyes don't hurt but like I said I do get headaches sometimes in my forehead but I always thought sinuses. But they were clear on the ct scan. Anyways can someone point me in the right direction on where to go and tell what their opinion is on my symptoms!! Thanks karyn",
