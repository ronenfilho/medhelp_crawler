            "answer": "I'm having my second child and second c section in 27 days! I'm not nervous because I know what to expect but my personal opinion is to have the c section and get your tunes tired because u don't want to go threw the whole process of healing and then go in for another surgery with a little one to take care of at home. It's all up to u tho! I wish u the best of luck..sorry your pregnancy hasn't been that smooth sailing. Congratulations on another healthy baby!",

Yes recovery can be rough but I don't know what recovery is like for having just a tubal so I'd research that cuz that seems like a lot recovering from a vaginal then having to have surgery.",

    "question": "I'm pregnant with #4 and planning on having my tubes tied.\u00a0\u00a0My doc says if I have a vaginal delivery (as all 3 of my other pregnancies were),\u00a0\u00a0I have to wait 4-5 weeks after birth to have my tubes tied,\u00a0\u00a0but if I have a c-section,\u00a0\u00a0he can do it right then.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering how hard it is getting your tubes tied after 4-5 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that the recovery time would be longer than if I just asked for the c-section and recovered from it and tying my tubes all at once. I'm 33 weeks and have gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. It's not preeclampsia yet,\u00a0\u00a0but he's watching for it. I just feel like time is running out for me to make a decision. Any opinions?",
