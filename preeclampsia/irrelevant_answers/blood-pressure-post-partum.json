            "answer": "Your doctors advise is pretty much spot on.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing i can add is to watch out for severe headaches unrelieved by Tylenol, or right upper quadrant abdominal pain.Either symptom, in light of ANY increased BP, should be promptly investigated.The farther out you get from delivery, the less worrisome your BP is as a symptom of pregnancy induced hypertension.Be aware, though, that hypertension in general may become sustained at any time.\u00a0\u00a0Women who have elevated BP's during pregnancy or for 6-8 weeks after, have an increased risk of having sustained hypertension at some point in their lives.",

    "question": "Does anyone know if it's normal for blood pressure to go up after delivery? I had dd a week ago via c-section. My BP during this pregnancy has been great and low, although i do have a history of preeclampsia in my previous pregnancy. Towards the end of the pregnancy it did creep up slightly, but was still well within normal. i think it went as high as 125/80 while pregnany. My BP when not pregnant is also normally nice and low- 110/60. While in the hospital, it had returned to normal.Yesterday I noticed swelling in my feet so I took my BP. it was 130/83- higher than it had been during my entire pregnancy. Today my highest reading was 131/92.While these numbers are high for me, I am aware that in general, they are not considered too high. My OB is vacation, and the covering dr is far from me. Since he doesn't know me, I know he wouldn't be concerned. When i was pregnant, I asked my OB what BP should get me worried. He said that as long as the bottom number was under 100, there was nothing to worry about. I am assuming the same applies to post partum. Therefore, I'm taking a wait and see approach. My OB did warn me that swelling can last several weeks, but I don't know if it's normal for BP to slowly creep up. For anyone who tracks their BP, did you notice an increase post partum??",
