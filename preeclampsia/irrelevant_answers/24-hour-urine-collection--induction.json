    "question": "I am 37w 2 days due the 28th and apparently there is protein in my urine... now I'm doing the 24 hour urine collection. My bp has steadily been rising but is only elevated slightly and not high. They are talking about inducing me thursday too... for some reason I get the feeling they are doing it just to induce me so I don't have the baby on Christmas because I don't have symptoms of preeclampsia besides them telling me I have protein.",
