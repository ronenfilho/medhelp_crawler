I'm 37 weeks tomorrow and haven't had a high reading since. Just remember to stay calm and focus on something else when you feel yourself getting worked it. Hang in there and I'll keep you in my prayers",

    "question": "went to my 19 week appointment yesterday. there was a little protein in my urine and my blood pressure was 138/66. throughout this pregnancy and in all previous pregnancies my blood pressure has been around 105/65. my midwife didn't think anything of it since both levels technically fell in the normal range, but at the very high end. I told her how out of character that was for my blood pressure, so she ordered a 24 hour urine test and some blood draws.today, I'm very shaky, tired, and dizzy. I know that being pregnant with twins I'm already at a higher risk, but I can't afford to go on bedrest and certainly don't want the risks associated with preeclampsia. I'm reaching out asking for prayers and experience. realistically, is it likely that I'll be diagnosed with preeclampsia and need bedrest?",
