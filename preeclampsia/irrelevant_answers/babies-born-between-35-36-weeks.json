            "answer": "My daughter was 34 weeks 5 days when she was born and she was 6lbs 4oz. She needed assistance breathing so she was on a c-pap, but only for about a day. She was in the NICU for a week because her feed had to be high enough before she could get discharged from there, an IV made up the rest of the nutrients while she was in the NICU. For about a year or so she was more sensitive to bright light and loud noises because she was premature. She will now be 3 in April and she is a healthy very busy girl and has been developing just fine.",

You baby may need a couple of days with extra care but he will be absolutely fine hun. Trust the docs to do what's best for you both. Its a good thing you're organised and ready for his arrival!! :-) 36 is only a week shy of full term at the end of the day. Can't wait to read the update saying he's here and you're both doing well. Best of luck xx",
