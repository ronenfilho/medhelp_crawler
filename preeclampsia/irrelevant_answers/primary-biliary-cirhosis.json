            "answer": "Your reaction is quite normal. Everybody gets scared when faced with health issues.I am a liver transplant recipient and I have had at least 7 and probably 8 liver biopsies.Not all of mine were CT or ultrasound guided but guided biopsies are the best and safest approach.I never had any anxiety medication but many people report that they were given a drug to help them relax. Some are given twilight anesthesia like Versed. I did have a topical\u00a0\u00a0injection of an anesthetic drug to numb the skin but that was all I was given. I never had any significant discomfort during my biopsies and the ultrasound guided one was nothing at all. I don't believe that you will have a lot of pain during the procedure.Some people do complain of some pain during the procedure but for the vast majority of people it is not a big deal. Probably the worst part for most is the anticipation and anxiety beforehand. The worst part for me is waiting for the results after the procedure.I don't know much about the amount of radiation involved in CT but I doubt it is significant.You will have to stay at the hospital for a few hours - 2 or 3 - after the procedure to insure there is no bleeding. You'll have to lie down for this waiting period and that can be rather boring.Here is a link to a thread about biopsies so you can read what other people have to say about the experience.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Hepatitis-C/liver-biopsy/show/1325025My best advice is to try and stay calm because, really, the procedure isn't a big deal. I always take it one day at a time with stuff like this. I have found it's much easier if you don't try and look too far down the road.I wish you the very best.Be well,Mike",

            "answer": "Hi Jilal,Hope you're doing well. How did your liver biopsy go? I also tested positive for only AMA antibodies, and my liver function tests and the ultrasound are normal, however I have Hashimoto's disease (hypothyroid). My hepatologist is running more tests to find out if I have PBC. Please let me know how you're feeling?Sincerely,Taline",

            "answer": "Hello Taline,My liver biopsy was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I did not feel a thing (actually it was so painless, that I did not even know that the doc. had done the biopsy).\u00a0\u00a0I am feeling fine.\u00a0\u00a0I was originally tested for AMA and ANA because my LFT's were slightly high test after test after test (originally it was thought that was from just having a baby, so no one made a big deal out of it).\u00a0\u00a0I also have, or I guess more correctly, had, Hasimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0I had\u00a0\u00a0a total thyroidectomy the end of March 2011 (which, did test positive for papillary cancer, but was so small the doc stated it did not spread anywhere else).\u00a0\u00a0I am from the Erie,PA area, and I have gone to see one doctor here.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a diagnosis of PBC based on the biopsy results ( he stated I was Stage 1 with minimal bile duct damage) and prescribed Actigall for me to take 2x daily.\u00a0\u00a0I asked him if I had this disease without any doubts.\u00a0\u00a0He stated he made a diagnosis of PBC based on everything together(LFT tests, biopsy).\u00a0\u00a0He stated the liver sometimes mimics other problems??? So I could not get a definite \"You , without a doubt have PBC\".....Anyways, I then went to see a doc. in Pittsburgh, PA.\u00a0\u00a0He also made that diagnosis, but gave the same type of answer as the first doc.\u00a0\u00a0He also added that I have a bit of a fatty liver and suggested I lose weight (igained about 50-60 lbs. when pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0He also told me to take Actigall, but instead of 2X daily, I should take it 3X daily.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of taking the medication then, I decided to test my LFT's a couple more times( between two doctors, I had several blood work orders).\u00a0\u00a0I tested them twice in a 3 month period, and both times the LFT's had gone down to normal (high end of normal, but normal) with the exception of GGT.\u00a0\u00a0My GGT both times was almost 3X higher than normal.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, I called both doc's., and they stated that with PBC your liver functions will constantly go up and go down.\u00a0\u00a0Every time they go up, some damage is done to your liver, which will eventually lead to cirhosis.\u00a0\u00a0The medication should keep the liver functions from going up and down, and just keep them at an even low level.I did just start the medication yesterday, but I made another appt. with a doc. at the Cleveland Clinic for a third opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know what is going on with you.Sincerely,Jill",

            "answer": "Hi Jill, how are you? Did you go to Cleveland to see the doctor? Hope you're doing well. I just saw a hepatologist at USC in LA and he told me that he was puzzled by my normal liver panel numbers and yet AMA positive. My liver ultrasound was normal as well, however there must be something slowly cooking. He asked for couple more tests. AMA M2 and Bile acids test and also GGT. We'll see how it goes. I am petrified and anxious most of the time, but I know that so many people with PBC can live a long life taking Ursodiol. I've been chatting with the PBCers organization members and they are so supportive. Check them out! Keep me posted sweetheart, and thank yo for replying to my post. You are in my prayers.Taline",
