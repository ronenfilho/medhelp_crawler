            "answer": "My blood pressure has been up at appointments too so i know how you feel. My doc told me that pre clampsia is when your blood pressure goes up in the third trimester. Before that could be from a pre existing condition. I have been monitoring my bp at different times of the day and it has been lower than in the doctors office. A one off reading isnt as accurate. Try not to stress too much and keep up with your appts and talk to your doctor. Husbands can tend to seem like they arent worried but he may not know what to say. Hope everything works out for you \u263a",

            "answer": "It could be white coat syndrome. I had the same thing happen at every appointment with my first. It was always between 150-160 when I went in. I would take it at like a Walmart though and I was always fine. My normal bp is 100-110. I ended up switching to my midwife at 28 weeks and even being that far along, the highest it ever was after that was 110. Try going to a Walmart or wherever you have that does free blood pressures. I promise, if you are the same as me, it will ease your mind. Be sure to let them know if you do that and it is different. You may not have to do all the testing. Good luck!",

            "answer": "typically preeclampsia doesn't start until the 3rd trimester. I had eclampsia with my first that began with preeclampsia starting around 27 weeks. With my second I had preeclampsia that set in around 35 weeks. I have heard of women getting severe preeclampsia at 21 or 22 weeks but it's rare... have they dipped your urine for protein? A 24 hour urine test might be done next and my OB has mentioned bp control meds that can be used for early hypertension...your bp is definitely alarmingly high...I hope this works out for you.

            "answer": "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure had been normal. Even a slight rise in blood pressure may be a sign of preeclampsia.Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious \u2014 even fatal \u2014 complications for both you and your baby. If you have preeclampsia, the only cure is delivery of your baby.If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia too early in your pregnancy to deliver your baby, you and your doctor face a challenging task. Your baby needs more time to mature, but you need to avoid putting yourself or your baby at risk of serious complications.",
