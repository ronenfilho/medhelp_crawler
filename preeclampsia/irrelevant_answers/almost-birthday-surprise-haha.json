    "question": "So today is my birthday and my whole family was joking that maybe my son would come for my birthday and I had a scare where my blood pressure was high so almost headed to the hospital but then it got normal so all is good for now. I had preeclampsia with my previous and yesterday my BP was high at my doctor's check up, so they told me if it got high to go in to l&d. But, everything under control. However I do hope my son comes soon. I'll be 37 eres in a couple hours!\u00a0\u00a0:)",
