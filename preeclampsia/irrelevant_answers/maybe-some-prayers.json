I had an app for the following weeks and 2 days later I made them see me because I wasn't getting any movements from baby even after doing all the right things, eating, drinking, being perfectly still... When I went in my fluid was way low and was induced that day. The reason I'm telling you this is so you know to keep track of your movements. They never told me what to really look for (one reason I'm going an hour out of town for my doc this time). I pray all is well. Blessings!",

    "question": "So Im 37 weeks 1 day and had an appointment today. My blood pressure wasn't considered high on scale or anything, but it was a little high for ME. Im usually around 115 over something and I was 132 over 90 today. Also, they found a protein thing in my urine which can be a sign of preeclampsia. AND my amniotic fluid is not considered low on the scale but did decrease a bit. I have another appointment in a week and am getting an ultrasound. Please pray though that its not preeclampsia (toximia)..",
