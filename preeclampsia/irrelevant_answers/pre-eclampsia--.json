Just when I saw that I was like oh my! Scary thought. Just was basically putting that in there to see if anyone who has had pre-eclampsia had seizures.Thanks camisutton88 for the info! I guess I should tell my doctor about my anxiety. I never spoke with one before bc I didn't want to be put on medications for it like the people in the rest of my family.. I'm weird about stuff like that I guess... I also have a very stressful job that I hate. 911 dispatcher, 12 hour night shifts.thank you all for your prayers. I will comment on this again after my doctors appointment with updates!",

Came back at my 36 week appt. and my bp was normal and they didn't run anymore tests. So, I hope the same goes for you, I wish you the best of luck, let us know how things goes!",

I'm 24 weeks and still no pre-e which will hopefully stay that way but you stressing thinking oh I've got this isn't helping. Bp runs high for so many different things.

It was simply one of the options my doctor discussed with me when they first saw the spike in my BP. I was curious if anyone had anything to share on high BP or pre-eclampsia. I have already seen my doctor again and they believe it's anxiety related as I have commented before. I've had anxiety for years before I was pregnant. (For anyone who truly has it, they know its not something you can help. But I cope with it just fine). & no I don't not smoke.",

I'm so nervous and have been trying to drink water like crazy and eat on the far spectrum of extreme super healthy. They told me one of the worries was pre-eclampsia. I was reading about it in my baby book and am so scared I'm going to get that. The idea with having seizures and my baby being delivered early bc of it just doesn't sit with me well. I just want a healthy pregnancy :/ anyone else have high BP issues?",
