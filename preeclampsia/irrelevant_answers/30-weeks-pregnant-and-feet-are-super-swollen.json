            "answer": "Grapefruit can help with water retention, adding a fair amount to your diet can help. Also maybe talk to your doctor about wearing a pair of compression socks, they aren't exactly glamorous but if they help maybe you would only have to wear them while at home.",

    "question": "Im 30 weeks with baby number two. My feet are super swollen. So far its not from preeclampsia as i was just in triage this last week with a horrible headache and everything was normal. Any tips to relieve the swelling? I drink tons of water all day long. I reduced my sodium intake almost totally. I dont drink caffeine as much. Im active. I put my feet up. I soak them. My fiance massages them. But its to the point that i cant even touch the floor with my toes on my right foot. Its painful but not too much. More just irritating. Im literally in only flip flops because my shoes and boots dont fit and im not gonna go out and buy new shoes to wear for a few months and not again after this babys born. I elevate my feet as often as i can but its hard when im chasing a two year old around all day. Any help is appreciated.",
