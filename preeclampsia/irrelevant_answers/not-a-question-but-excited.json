    "question": "Im so excited. Met with my ob and he is gonna allow me to do a vbac. Since I had an emergency csection at 35weeks with my son due to preeclampsia he says Im a good candidate for a vbac. There are some conditions though. I can't be induced by medications so I would have to go into labor on my own. Usually they do scheduled csections at 39weeks but he said he will schedule mine on my due date on Dec 19th to give me time to try to go into labor on my own. I just wanted the option of doing a vbac. And I have one now so Im hoping that I will be able to experience natural child birth!!! :)",
