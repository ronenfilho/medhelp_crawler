            "answer": "Often I get annoyed with some side effects of pregnancy too but my friend with babies keep telling me; that it's a rough road but will be really worth it once your through. Just try to find some hope, and don't become jealous of other pregnant women that don't have the same problem...everybody has their own problems to deal with its hard to judge from the outside...Just keep strong, you came so far already! Haven't lost your baby or could be in a much worse situation. Keep praying before you go to bed and ask for strength and a healthy baby. Ask your friends and partner for support, to take you on a relaxing walk Or to join you and entertain you in the doctors office. Treat yourself well and do things you love, even if you have to restrain from certain foods, come up with something else you love or that's a treat to you that you can do...the better you can feel in your body and mind and get you mind off your problems the more easier everything will be on you. And don't forget you are almost thru the whole pregnancy and time flies! Good luck and keep strong!",

    "question": "I'm 31 weeks and I'm tired of being pregnant. More specifically the complications.At 26 weeks I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I control with diet and take my blood sugar 4 times a day. It's getting a bit annoying. I'm cranky because I can't eat what I'm craving. And I feel like all I do is eat (6 meals/snacks a day).At 28 weeks I had a second elevated blood pressure reading. I was sent for blood work and a 24 hour urine test. At 30 weeks my doctor said I was leaking protein and said I had boarderline preeclampsia. He expects that I will progress to have full preeclampsia. I have weekly visits and monitor my blood pressure 4 times a day.At my appointment on Thursday I found out I have a UTI.I am tired. Tired of the testing. Tired of worrying. This is all for my baby and I don't regret any of it. It's just hard when I see the other preggie mom in my office who doean't even take prenatals waltz through her pregnancy with no problems.I needed to vent. Thanks.",
