            "answer": "Im sorry hun. I went through the same thing when i was pregnant with my first son 7 years ago and i was only 18 years old. It is very scary and nervewracking especially when the doc isnt giving you the feedback u need.\u00a0\u00a0Im not a doc so i cant be much of help to you but what i can say is hang in there and try not to stress. The goal is to try to keep your baby in as long as u can closest to full term with baby being safe of course. Drink lots of water, stay off your feet. Good luck!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed yesterday and I'm now on bedrest and get nonstress test twice a week and blood work done once a week. I'm 31+6 and always on here venting. they r sending me to uva our biggest hospital near by for an opinion on what to do. Worse thing is it seems my doctor eludes questions I ask her and tries to rush us out every appointment I forget questions. I'm starting to get aggravated cause I'm scared. My mom has said to me today that I have every single problem she had with my brother and she had him at 32 weeks. I went in today and they didn't even measure my stomach I don't think my doctor realizes how scary this is for me being my first child. I'm freaking out like crazy plus my fiances plus my fiance is starting a new job so he won't be home as often. Ahhh I'm going nuts.",
