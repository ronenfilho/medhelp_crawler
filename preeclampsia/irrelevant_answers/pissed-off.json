I am thinking they already let her know since she's the one who resched my appointment with her today. Yes. I was supposed to meet her but they said I have to be induced. Now I guess back to just normal appointment. She wants me to go in at 12. What pisses me off the most one of the reasons I'm gonna be induced today besides my condition is bcuz she's gonna be off the whole week next week and not gonna be in tomorrow and even Friday. Shes like a part time I guess. She doesn't work 24/7 like other doctors. Ughhhh",

Would you prefer they begin your induction and have you sit in the waiting room?\u00a0\u00a0I doubt it.Pre-eclampsia is not a joking matter, but it also isn't an emergency at this point... unless you freak out about this small bump in the road to the point of YOU causing your own blood pressure to shoot through the roof.As babies are born today, rooms will clear out and you can be admitted. There is no reason the flip out. Just call every now and then a red mitered see if if there is an open room.",

I spent the night in the maternity ward. They changed their minds and I didn't end up getting induced until two weeks after. My partner took the week off to be with me incase, we saw the doctor and he said he would wait one week to get me as close to possible to my due date. So my partner went back to work for a week and then took two weeks off the day I was induced. It was such a pain because it cut into his leave when they originally planned to induce me! I'm not gonna lie , it was extremely fustrating but now I look back, I understand why these decision were made. It made us both and my family worried sick for two weeks not knowing but we got through it and bub is as healthy as can be! He's only 3weeks old :) try not to stress out lovely, just keep an eye on yourself and if you're feeling to off, head into emergency and get checked out? Wishing you the best x",

But even before we get there they called and said they have lots of patients and can't take me in. They want me to call at 12 to check if there's any available room for me. I was like wtf. I really dont have any choice but cope up with this hospital since this is the only hospital in the city. Wow... If they really think I'm high risk over my pre eclampsia that right when they found out about my result they wanted to induced me doesn't that mean Its considered emergency? Now they want me to call them round 12 just to check!!! I asked about tomorrow they said not sure but maybe this Friday. Wtf?!",
