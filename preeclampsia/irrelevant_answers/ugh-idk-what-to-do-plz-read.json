            "answer": "I gained 70 pounds with my son, and lost it all plus some. Got down to a size 4. Of course I got pregnant again and have already gained 55 pounds at week 33. The only down side I've noticed with that much weight gain was that my son was 9 pounds when he was born (lots of stitches) but very healthy so that was good, and you probably will get stretch marks if you don't have them already. A lot of it could just be excess fluid. I lost 40 pounds by the time I left the hospital.",

They worry because excessive weight gain puts you at risk for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and preeclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0as well as greatly increases the likelihood that you'll need a csection and increases your risk for post-op infection and complications.",
