            "answer": "I had pre-eclamsia with my now 11 year old son. I am due September 16 so that makes me a little over 30 weeks pregnant right now. So far, I have had excellent blood pressure. However, my now husband and father of my unborn baby is not the biological father of Mt 11 year old. My doctor told me that studies show that the 'trait\" for pre-eclamsia actually comes from the father. He predicted early on that I would have no complications with this one since it's a different father and he was sure right.",

            "answer": "If you have it once you are more likely to have it again. My sister had ecclampsia with her first and 2nd, her last two she started showing symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0but she has scheduled c-sections with them so we can't say for sure if it would have developed. I've researched it alot and never heard it being anything about the father. In fact if your mother or sister had it, you are more likely to have it. My sisters oldest two have a different dad than her youngest two, and she has either had it or shown signs of it with all 4 childred. Good luck, I hope you don't have a repeat!",

A few of my cousins had it too one of them was going great then at 37 weeks her blood pressure went severely high they tested her and showed it was preclampsia and had to have the baby right away. So by the looks of other comment may not get it again or you may get it last few weeks.",
