    "question": "I posted a question yesterday about low movement from baby and when to be concerned. Well called ob office and they told me to drink a soda and have a candy bar. Lay on my side and I should count 10 kicks in 2 hours. Well I didnt feel anything so I ended up going to labor and delivery triage.\u00a0\u00a0Babys heart beat was good. My blood pressure was really high.\u00a0\u00a0So they took some blood tested urine and possibly think I am on the verge of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Well I have a terrible cold that came out of nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm still not feeling baby like normal. Thankfully I see my ob tomorrow for my glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just so worried.\u00a0\u00a0He has slowed down for sure. I hope they do an ultrasound bc I am worried something isnt right. I've been really bloated with pains in my stomache. I need to not stress but its hard. I also got put on a weight restriction when he comes to lifting bc of my job. So now I cant work at the moment. ..",
