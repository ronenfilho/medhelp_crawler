            "answer": "It's possible that your water breaks. The doctor told me that its likely that your second child will come quicker than your first because your body already knows what to do. I had my daughter at 38 weeks exact, so I can either have him this week or next week. I'll be 38 weeks next week. So if you feel regular contractions go to the hospital..in fact time them",

            "answer": "It sounds like discharge to me. From my understanding when your water breaks it is clear and not creamy. I'm 26 weeks and experience discharge like that a couple times a week. Always safe to call your doctor and explain symptoms though. It is common for second babies to come early but doesn't always happen. I know a few girls who had their first early and went over due on their second. Also, where your first baby was taken early because of pre eclampsia I wouldn't go based on how far along you were with that one. There is no telling when they would have come if you hadn't needed medical intervention. Good luck in your pregnancy!",
