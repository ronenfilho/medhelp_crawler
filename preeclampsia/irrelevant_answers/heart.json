            "answer": "It's really not that unusual to be having more PVCs during sleep. Your dreams alone could cause that to happen. People die in their sleep all the time and that is one reason why. Understand that that is rare and I'm not saying that's what is going to happen to you. People who die usually have underlying serious forms of heart disease. ALL people have PVCs and most have more PACs than PVCs. It's how much heart disease is present which determines if those extra beats are important or not.",
