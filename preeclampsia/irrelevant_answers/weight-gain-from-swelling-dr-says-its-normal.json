            "answer": "I lost 12 lbs in 2 days and peed non stop (almost!) After I delivered my son early from pre E. Be careful on salt and hidden salt until you deliver. You will lose a lot of water weight quickly. Just continue to eat healthy, get good fluids (try to really avoid caffeine) and you'll be fine :)",

            "answer": "Yea I'm now in the hospital being induced because of my BP & swelling. I look horrible! My hands look like when you blow air into an exam glove! I appreciate the response, it makes me feel better to know someone has been there and understands & can let me know what to expect! The doc said with how much I've gained in fluid that it will be a drastic change, I hope he's right lol! They are putting me on pitocin in a few hours so hopefully my little girl will be here before the day is over! Thanks for your reply!",

    "question": "Anyone else out there currently or previously diagnosed with preeclampsia? I was diagnosed a few weeks ago, I am now 37wks pregnant and since 30wks I have packed on an astonishing and terrifying 70lbs! I do have my cravings for junk food but not to that extent! I eat very healthy and had been maintaining a very healthy weight, the doc said that all the new weight is from fluid and swelling. And my baby is slightly under weight which is strange to me because babies born to overweight mommies usually are bigger. I just want to know what others thoughts were on this. It's insane to gain so much so fast and doc says I'll lose it quickly after the birth of the baby because birth cures preeclampsia.",
