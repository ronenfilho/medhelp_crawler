Chasing a hyperactive 5 year old\u00a0\u00a0around all day in this condition is so taxing! But totally worth it for a healthy pregnancy :)",

            "answer": "I just had my baby the 4th at 38 weeks and the night before I was really tired and slept through the whole night(which never happens) and the whole week I was nestings with a bunch of energy. The day of my delivery I had contractions on and off all day that were more intense then that afternoon my water broke and I had her 9:34 that night! I hope that helps! Everyone may be different but that's just my experience. Hopefully you make some progress soon and have a speedy delivery and recovery! P.S. I had been at 2cm 70%effaced for almost two weeks before I delivered her. Good luck!!",

    "question": "Can anyone shed some light for me on what/how you felt in the days or week(s) leading up to labor? I was induced with my first @ 37 weeks because of severe preeclampsia and was miserable for the last three months lol so I have no idea what the end of a normal healthy pregnancy feels like. What I know is that I'm days shy of 37 weeks, and have been miserable for days now. In a funk of sorts with short spurts of energy, completely uncomfortable, and having some pain on and off. I think my poor 5y/o thinks I'm going crazy because I cry at least once a day for no good reason at all and I have to take naps without fail at midday... Just wondering if any other moms could give some insight into what to expect... Sorry for the whining, I'm just so so ready to be done!!!!",
