    "question": "So I was induced into labor the 30th do to hypertension (not preeclampsia) I was in labor for 28hrs.. It stated off feeling like I was in my period then went to small contractions. I wanted to wait to wait as long as I can so it didn't \u201dwear off\" MISTAKE #1 it doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\"wear off\" they give you this magical button to press it allows you press y periodically. So anyways when I got the epidural it didn't really \"hurt\" but it feels extremely weird. But when they got it face it to me and the doctor left all of a sudden the babies heart rate dropped! The nurse got it up as quickly as possible. Apparently this happens sometimes when you get the epidural cuz your blood pressure drops. So I was scared that the epidural was the reason why so I started to regret getting it.. So I avoided pressing the button completely is only going to push it when I was going to push. MISTAKE #2\u00a0\u00a0it definitely wasnt the epidural. (I later found out it was the inducing medication my body didn't like it. It was also causing me to have overlapping contractions) The epidural does not affect the baby at all. Mostly just the momma (in a good way) so at this point I was in horrible pain and ended up pushing the button but the pain never fully went away. The nurse informed me that I wasn't being able to \"catch up\" so I ended up getting to the point where my stomach felt like I was connecting the whole time and I want even contracting when i did it was even worse. So they had to shoot me up with more and up my dose with the button. So I started pressing that button EVERY chance I got. They informed me that you CANNOT overdose on it and it WILL NOT harm the baby so I went for it. The BEST decision I made that whole 28hrs!I hope this helps your decision and help your experience!I would suggest DEFINITELY getting the epidural! It is definitely the best thing about the labor process!",
