            "answer": "It might not. I had preeclamplsia with my first and had a csection because bp was 170/140 after 7wks of bp meds and I was too ill for an induction. This time I have preeclamplsia again, developed at 15wks and just starting to now not respond to bp meds at 30wks and they'll do another csection because I'm too ill again and vaginal delivery will increase bp when its already dangerously high. But if your bp is only slightly above 140/90 and not too much protein that might allow you. Wishing you lots of luck!",

All they did is put me on bed rest.",

    "question": "So im 31 weeks today I've been nagging terrible headaches, hot flashes like to the point I have to sit down and feel like passing out etc. I took my bp earlier and it was 140/78 my bp normally runs 116/68. Husband took me to the squad bay to have them double check and there they got 142/76. Bottom number not so bad or to high for me but very glad I have a doctor's appt on Monday. Fearful im developing preeclampsia which could definitely ruin my vbac plans. But in the end either way ik I will have to do what id safest for us.",
