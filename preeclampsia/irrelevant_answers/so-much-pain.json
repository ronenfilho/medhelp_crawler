    "question": "I don't know if what I'm feeling is contractions I asked the nurse to explain them but she didn't. My lower back hurts really bad. I'm laying down and the pain isn't going away. It feels like I'm having massive cramps. I went to the bathroom a bit ago a pottyed then wiped and had a pinkish discharge but no bloody show. I'm 36 weeks I'm being induced next week for medical problems(preeclampsia) they said yesterday if I were to go into labor they'd do nothing to stop it at this point. I'm a ftm. I've been getting up every 30-40 mins to pee all night and Everytime I awoke I was in pain.",
