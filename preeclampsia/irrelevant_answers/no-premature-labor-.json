    "question": "Went to doctors they did a swab to see if I'm at risk of going into labor in next 7 days if it comes back positive they going to give me steroids to mature his lungs and then wait and see what happens. But so far my cervix has softened but not dilated. Blood pressure was high when I first went in but after sitting and laying down it went back down. Just given few restrictions and they are going to be keeping an eye on my blood pressure for preeclampsia. Goal is to make sure I at least make it to 36 weeks.",
