            "answer": "Decaf ONLY.Caffiene can cause misscarriages.So that means cut back on soda, or anything like that.Coffee... lots of teas... some juices even.You can still drink them, but my doc told me if I were to drink them, I can only choose one of those caffiene drinks, and only drink it ONCE a day.But I drank alot of sweat teas and sodas when I first got pregnant, and I have a healthy baby so far!But I do stick to what the doctor says, I either get one glass of sweet tea a day, or one glass of my beloved Orange or Grape soda a day. lol.I heard the Arizona teas are okay though?I dunno if you've ever heard of Arizona tea before... but you can find them pretty much at any gas station in the fridges... they come in different size bottles.",

    "question": "hey gals.... i just wanted everyone's input on drinking tea while pregnant. i've been to several sites and they are all very contradicting. One site says its ok, but to drink it in moderation, and another site says it can lower your folic levels and could cause preeclampsia, preterm labor, prolonged labors, and postpartum hemorrhage. i know a lot of women who have drank tea while being pregnant and their baby's are absolutely fine. Can anyone recommend a different kind of tea thats safe? im going to ask my doctor when i see him in a few weeks, i just thought i'd ask you ladies first.",
