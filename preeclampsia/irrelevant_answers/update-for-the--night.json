I bet my 3am sugar will be high. and my fasting will be too. I just need to stop stressing out.My BP went down to 133/77. They will check it again at midnight. They are still doing a 24 hr urinalysis. So we will see what that shows. I wonder how long it takes to get the results back. I'm tired and bored, but can't sleep. I just want to know whats going on and what they are going to do. I want to know when I'm going to have my baby girl. I'm so excited I guess. I just want to have her and hold her and go home with my oldest daughter and just be a family.I am having contractions though. Small ones, but they are more regular than I knew. I love it, I have contractions I don't feel.",

I have done the 24 hr urine check twice since Ive been here and the results have come back within 2 hours both times (even after 5 pm and on the weekend), so I would assume it would be the same there. Also, I dont know how you feel about it but when I couldnt sleep I told them and they gave me 10mg of ambien and it worked really well until about 4 in the morning...and something is better than nothing around here. Another thing that helps is having my own pillow from home bc it smells like home and its comforting.",
