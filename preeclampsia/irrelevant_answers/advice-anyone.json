    "question": "Im 37 weeks and have gestational hypertension, i dont think id worry so much if it were being controlled but my obgyn and specialist wont put me on any medications because im so far along and high risk already, the goal now is to have the baby. I was told to go in to the hospital if i got headaches or felt my bp was up, so ive done so. Not once but twice since my last appt a week ago. The hospital keeps me a couple hours my bp goes down they send me home.....i delivered my other 2 baby's early at 32 weeks. I had preeclampsia with my son and placental abruption with my daughter. Theres so many risk factors for early labor and now with my bp constantly fluctuating and not being controlled i am worried that its distressing my unborn baby. I know the doctors are doing what they think is best and giving my baby girl a little more time to grow in my belly but it seems like since I'm full term delivery would be the best option.",
