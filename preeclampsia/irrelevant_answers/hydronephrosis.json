    "question": "I am 31+6 pregnant with my third baby. I was diagnosed with hydronephrosis in my right kidney at 18 weeks. The pain has been tolerable for the most part and not very bothersome. For a month now my blood pressure has risen some but all blood work has come back perfect and so have urine tests.\u00a0\u00a0But for the past three days I have had swelling like I have never had in a pregnancy with my legs swelling up to my knees even if I stay off my feet. I had blood pressure issues with both prior pregnancies with preeclampsia in my first at delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been experiencing a lot of pain in my right side that I am assuming is my kidney for the past two days. I drink 100+ ounces of water a day per Dr. orders. Do I need to go get my swelling and kidney checked?? I was at the doctor the day before this began three days ago.",
