            "answer": "Its really a waiting game when it comes to preeclampsia. Ive been dealing with all the symptoms since I was 28 weeks and im now 38 weeks. My ob practice has 10 different drs who all had different opinions on what should be done. So for 8 weeks it was a watching and waiting game of twice weekly sonos and non stress tests to be sure the baby was ok. I went into labor 2 days ago than it stopped. We thought I went into full blown preeclampsia the same night and I was admitted, they thought they were going to induce but everything went back to normal. Im scheduled to be induced now next week at 38 weeks. The biggest thing my drs are worried about is the blood pressure. They said the protein in the urine doesnt necessarily mean preeclampsia it could be infection ( like a uti) or its just normal for your liver to do that. I was put on bedrest almost 4 weeks ago which helped. You just have to relax and keep baby in as long as u can. U got the shots for babys lungs which are the biggest development issue at this point. Your being monitored and your bp came down which is good. Good luck and try to remain calm because worrying and stress is the last thing you need. ( :",
