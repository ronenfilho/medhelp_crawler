            "answer": "I am 35 weeks and had my only high blood pressure reading at my appointment yesterday. I'm doing a urine test all day today to make sure there are no problems with my kidneys or liver. I've been reading into preeclampsia because I'm concerned I may be diagnosed with it as well.Good luck to you! I am already being monitored weekly because I have gestational diabetes. It was a nuisance at first, but now I'm glad I get reassurance every week.",

            "answer": "I had preeclampsia with my first daughter and she was an emergency c section at 34 weeks and 6 days. She was born at 4lbs 1oz 15 in long. She was in the NICU for 2 weeks but she was completely healthy. She was there until she gained weight. I was in ICU for a week and didn't meet my precious baby until she was 3 days old. I was the one with all the problems, not her. Not to mention, I also had pulmonary edema. My pregnancy was 100% healthy until that week. All I can say is STAY HYDRATED! It actually helps decrease the protein increase in your urine.",

Thanks to a group of doctors monitoring me this time around, we have been avoiding a preeclampsia repeat.I have been taking baby aspirin and calcium tablets daily and I think it played a big part in avoiding preeclampsia this time around, plus lots and lots of water. Your uterus needs a MINIMUM of 90oz of water daily!!!",
