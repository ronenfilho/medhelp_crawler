            "answer": "You need to tell your doc asap. Expecally if you have swelling in your hands and face. They will check your protein levels and blood pressure for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is very serious and can develop over night. The only cure is to deliver the baby. I had it twice and had to deliver at 32 weeks and 30 weeks with my kids. Good luck. I hope you don't get it.",
