            "answer": "HiSorry for your loss.Once the bleeding has coompletly stopped then you can have sex.When I had my missed miscarriage, I was advised not to have sex for at least 2 weeks.In my opinion give it 1-2 cycles and then start trying again. This gives your body some time to settle and heal itself.Nothing is wrong with you, it just one of those things that happen. It happened to me this Year with a missed miscarriage on my 1st pregancy. You have 2 healthy kids already, so ur body is very capable. In my situation and not sure if my body is capable as I have no children, so for me it's really a 50/50 chance. Hopefully it's just one of those things and all willl be well next time, but will have to see next time.I am sure you will be fine next time, just try and be positive as much as possible, u have done this twice and you can again.Takecare ;-)Rach",
