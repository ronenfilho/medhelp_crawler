My feet are swollen and tingly my hands too. I'm cramping at home and very uncomfortable. I'm 37 weeks 5 days now.\u00a0\u00a0My next stress test is this coming Wednesday along with my 38 week check up.

    "question": "I went to the hospital last night because I was cramping. Turns out I was not in labor, but my BP was high. After testing for pre-eclampsia, they sent me home and told me to do at home testing since my BP was not too bad and the tests came back OK. They will test more tomorrow to determine what needs to be done. This is the first time ever that my BP was off. Any of you ladies ever have issues with pre-eclampsia or something similar to this? I'm OK with being induced, but this waiting to see makes me nervous.",
