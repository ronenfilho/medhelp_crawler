    "question": "So everything went great with the measurements and the ultrasound in general. My boy weighed 11oz and the doc said that was a bit underweight for 21 weeks but all else with him looked normal. My placenta was inflamed so he put me on baby aspirin to hopefully fix that cuz the blood flow frombaby thru placenta wasn't normal,but blood flow to baby was great. Have another ultrasound on April 8th to make sure he's gaining weight and they want to monitor me for high blood pressure and protein in urine becuz I'm at a higher risk for preeclampsia later.I just hope he's healthy and that my placenta shrinks enough to fix the blood flow so that he can last til 36 weeks at least before delivery. Anyone else have this issue and things were ok? He told me not to worry and forget all he said,but I'm ocd and anxiety prone so I worry 24/7..",
