            "answer": "It's not a major benefit to check generally, there are a lot of other checks that tell a provider more if they are willing to take the time to talk and listen. However most physicians just check because it's quicker than other methods of care. If you want to be checked you can ask them though, but figure out what you actually want to know and why. If you're told you're 2cm what will it mean to you? Do you need to know? Do you want to? Will it change the way you prepare for birth? If being checked changes nothing, then maybe you'd rather someone didn't stick their fingers up there! Totally your choice, and if you really want it, and they say no, ask why and then insist on it.",

            "answer": "Last time they checked they just used the vaginal ultrasound to measure. Not actual fingers. But you've a point about asking myself why. I don't really know. I guess I'm just curious.I want to know what it feels like if it feels any different. Since I don't really feel any contractions now even though the monitor registers some mild ones, and the doctor's and midwives want to perform the cesarean before I go into labor, I feel like I'm missing out on some of the fundamental experiences of being pregnant.I won't get the natural birth experience I want, or even a vaginal delivery, and I understand and accept the reasons why. But these last couple weeks are the last chance I'll get to feel my baby move inside me and I already miss it. I know it'll be different. I know I'll have her in my arms instead. But I feel like by not experiencing the whole end of pregnancy with contractions and dilation and expectation.. the whole roller coaster rush of emotions and sensations... that I'm missing out before she's even born.I hate how she hasn't turned and we have to do the whole cesarean thing, but I love how she's showing character by being stubborn and pushing it kicking out when someone tries to apply pressure on her or, as she probably sees it, encroaches on her space. I can't wait to see this character in person, but at the same time feel like she's safer where she is...I think I ran off on a tangent... forgive my venting.",

    "question": "I haven't been checked for dilation since I first told them I had some contractions. I stopped feeling any contractions for a couple weeks already, so each time I go to my appointments they just check on the baby and say if she's healthy and then I can go. I've been admitted to the hospital twice already for blood pressure, this last time a 24hr stay for monitoring, but other than being cleared of preeclampsia and being told that the monitor is registering some mild contractions, I have no idea if I'm even dilated at all.My next appointment is on Wednesday. Should I ask for the doctor to check then or should they check automatically whether or not I feel any contractions? I kinda feel odd that they don't check unless you are having symptoms. I'm already over 37 wks.. But then again, this is my first pregnancy and I don't really know how things are supposed to go.. :/",
