There isn't much you can do, maybe just watch the foods that you eat (too much salt can.raise blood pressure) or try meditation to lower it slightly. But all in all of you are feeling okay, I wouldn't worry about it.",

            "answer": "How far along are you? That will make a big difference in your doctor's plan. It did happen to me multiple times between my last two pregnancies. For me, and for you as well being a first time mom:), it was probably nerves since it went down when you had it rechecked. Towards the end of pregnancy I always felt like I was rushing around and worried about what I would find out about my progress and due date. If the nurse was nice enough to recheck my BP before I left it would go down. Relax as much as possible, try to arrive early to your next appt so you have a few minutes to look at a magazine or something. I hope everything continues to go well.",

            "answer": "I had trace amounts just a couple weeks ago in myurine as well and. my bp was high for me. They watched it and the protein went down (i was told it could be the Dr office lab not having as clean of a lab as the actual lab), and my bp regulated on its own.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that they double checked to be on the safe side. Make sure you are also drinking enough water which could cause the protein as well since your body won't flush the toxins (proteins) out. Wait til your next check and take the above advice as well....and sounds like you will be fine.",

            "answer": "I had pre ecclampsia w/ my daughter. If you're continuing to run high, they will most likely induce your labor a little early, If you're not close to delivery they will put you on bp meds to keep your pressure down. Cut out all salt in your diet, it will really help not aggravate the situation. it sounds like this time they sent you to the hospital just to make sure but they will most likely keep a very close eye on you perhaps increase the amount of appointments you have, things like that",

    "question": "Hi ladies. I went to the doctor on Monday for my typical monthly check up when they checked my blood pressure and noticed it was a little high. 140 over 90. They checked my urine and said there was a small trace of protein in it. They sent be over to the hospital to monitor it and so mite blood work and the hospital said my blood pressure was beautiful and blood work was fine. Should i be worried? I've heard of preeclampsia, (this is my first child) so I'm a little worried about that. Has anyone had the same thing happen to them? is there anything i should be doing differently?",
