            "answer": "It is not normal and yes very life threatening to you and baby. It will go away once baby is delivered but if you've had it once during pregnancy the likelihood of getting it again is high. High blood pressure, seeing spots, headaches, and swelling are all signs. I would get checked out immediately if experiencing symptoms.",

            "answer": "I had it in first pregnancy and bub and I nearly didn't make it, csection saved our lives. I'd had a pain in my right side under my ribs from early on but drs dismissed it, then I startef to feel generally unwell around 20wks, at 28wks my ankles face and wrists had swallon huge and I was seeing spots. Went to OB and my blood pressure was 170/140. Was in and out of hospital getting progressively more sick until they delivered at 35wks. Instantly felt better and PE symptoms disappeared within a week. High risk again for this pregnancy but have been on medication since 6wks to try to prevent it from happening again.",
