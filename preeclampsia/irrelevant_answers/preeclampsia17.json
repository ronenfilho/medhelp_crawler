She was born 9.10.14. Shes been in the NICU every since and she is doing absolutely fine. Shes a fiesty lil thing always trying to fight her nurses lol. Shes on a ventilator whch is there to help her breathe but she breathes over the machine so its only in place just incase she needs it and they ddnt want to pull it to soon then have to reinsert it. I must say she is little and its my 1st baby so im scared to touch her. But she started picking up her weight now.",

Some signs are bad headaches that don't go away with Tylenol. Major swelling in hands,feet and face. A dull pain in the top right of your stomach and seeing \"stars\"(blurry vision).. I haven't had any symptoms luckily besides the couple high blood pressures and protein in my urine but I get monitored twice a week and have a drs appointment once a week. Preeclampsia can be scary, that's why they monitor so closely but it can also be kept under control. I also take baby aspirin once a day.",
