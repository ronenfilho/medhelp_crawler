Now due January 20 not the 24. And all my blood tests came back I don't have overactive thyroid and so far no preeclampsia. And finally gained 3 pounds. Everything is going great. Lol my daughter on the other hand wants a sister not a brother.\u00a0\u00a0But that will change hopefully because\u00a0\u00a0she originally wanted a brother anyway. Just so excited. Can't post it anywhere else but here because I don't want to Facebook anything till after the baby is born.",
