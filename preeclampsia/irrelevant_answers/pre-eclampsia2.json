She had to get an emergency\u00a0\u00a0c section and he was born 6 weeks early. He had to stay in nicu\u00a0\u00a0for over a month. They cough it to late and they both almost died. So please be careful and do whatever the dr says so you have a safe rest of your pregnancy .",

            "answer": "Laat week my Dr said my baby has started to loose weight instead of gaining. Seeing him again tomorrow to see if it has changed and to find out whether I will be having a csection or be induced.It affects the blood supply to the baby via your placenta, and can cause premature birth and low birth weight.I have also heard it can cause baby to have seizures inside the womb, but have fortunately not experienced that.It is life threatening though, so it is very important to do as your Dr says!Good luck ladies!",

            "answer": "My son was born a little under 3 weeks early due to preeclampsia. I went in for my 37 week check up and my blood pressure was high (which it had never been in prior appointments) and I was leaking proteins in my urine (also never had occurred). They sent me to the hospital and ran a few blood tests prior to admitting me. Because I was 37 weeks, they induced me but ended up having to have a c-section because I wasn't dilating. My son was born the next day.The worry with preeclampsia is that your blood pressure could get too high and you could have a stroke. The only \"cure\" is having the baby be delivered.",
