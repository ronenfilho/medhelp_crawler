            "answer": "Yes I totally felt like that after my c-section. But I had a hard time going to the bathroom. It hurt to push if you kow what I mean. Also if your nursing, pumping you will loose tons of weight from that.If you keep nursing after a while your will get your hunger back and want to eat non stop. I would eat non stop and still loose weight.Mabye just check with the doc just to be safe. Look over your after c-section insctuctions as well.",

    "question": "i had an emergency c-section 12 days ago due to preeclampsia. i never really got my appetite back, but i think it's because my stomach probably shrank from not being to eat much when i was so big. i can eat, i just don't really feel hungry and find myself forgetting to eat. in the past few days it seems like i have stopped digesting food properly. i really don't think it's a stomach bug or anything- no stomach pains, no fever. tmi, i know... but what goes in comes out in pretty much the same condition. it's not frequent diarrhea, just not long after i eat a meal. could this be related to the c-section or the preeclampsia? did anyone else who had a c-sec experience anything like this? i've lost 22 lbs since delivering. i thought it was just because i had retained so much fluid, and because i am pumping (baby still won't latch). any insight would be appreciated. thanks.",
