            "answer": "You and/or your baby can die. Its a liver disease. My mom had it with me, so she had a c section I was a month early. But there are signs and you can prevent it. Doctor will say you can't and no one noes What it is from. But if you have at least 90grams of protein a day, you will most likely not get it. I'm sure there is still a small chance, but there was a study done and all the women that had at least 90grams a day didn't get it and the ones that didn't have 90grams did get it.",

            "answer": "I have it again and I'm having a csection tomorrow at 36wks. My first was delivered at 35wks. For me it has nothing to do with how much protein I eat, I just don't grow very good placentas which puts pressure on my liver and effects my kidneys. It is a serious condition and my dr has worked very hard to balance my health and the need for time for my baby to develop. Unfortunately there is no prevention andbthe only cure is to deliver the baby and placenta, however sometimes depending on the severity then symptoms can be managed long enough to get a good outcome so as soon as you think you have symptoms you should get checked out.",
