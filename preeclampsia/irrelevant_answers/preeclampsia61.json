            "answer": "Hi, found your post..... Anyways... Ill give you some general information on Preeclampsia.Since they are checking you for liver/kidney function itll give them a clear picture whether or not you actually have PreeC. They will contintue to monitor you though. If you end up with protien in your urine, they will be checking up on you quite often...Since you are only about 30 wks along, if preeclampsia is mild (not severe) they will watch you closely... labwork and such.... If at any point it becomes severe then you are probably looking at a c section....... Reason being, you are still not close enough to term to be \"induced\" just because of Preec being mild.If lets say you were about 36 wks along with mild preeclampsia, your ob wouldve probably induced you because you are close-enough to term. But since you are 30 wks the doctors will try to let your little one cook as long as they can without risking your life for it.Its more of a happy baby/happy mommy situation... healthy mom = healthy baby.There is no way to \"prevent\" it, many have tried to study and get information but the research only gives conflicting proof. Just go to your appoitments, take pre natals.....ALSO Do you drink enough water? As i was being induced my BP dropped down to normal bc of the fluids. Which was a miracle. DRINK TONS AND TONS of WATER. This might be the simplest reason \"rest\" and such hasnt improved your hbp.If you have any Q, you can ask me on here or msg me. Ill check back to your post for updates.",
