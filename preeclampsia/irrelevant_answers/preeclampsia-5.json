They said the fear is if the protein and bp are high you may have preeclamsia. It can cause stress to the baby and you may have to deliver early.\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm only 21 weeks they are keeping a very close eye. They want me to keep checking my bp and watch what I eat, limiting the salt.Good luck!",
