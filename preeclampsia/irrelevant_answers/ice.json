            "answer": "Ice will not create preeclampsia, but if you are craving ice or it tastes unusually delicious, that is a sign of anemia.\u00a0\u00a0Anemia can definitely happen during pregnancy -- you're producing blood for two -- and if you have it you should be diagnosed so you can increase your iron intake.\u00a0\u00a0Either that or just begin to take an iron supplement on top of your prenatal, (and probably a fiber gummy too because iron can be so constipating), and see if you feel more energetic and/or if your ice cravings change to something more like your intake before pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if anemia can cause preeclampsia ... if so, that might be the connection people are making.\u00a0\u00a0Not ice creates preeclampsia but ice cravings suggest anemia which can cause preecampsia.\u00a0\u00a0But I don't know if there is that link or not.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, in your shoes I'd take some iron.",
