            "answer": "I had a horrible, horrible experience. My preeclampsia was misdiagnosed with my first pregnancy. Ended up developing into HELLP syndrome and emergency c-section at 34 going on 35 weeks. Beginning liver failure, double kidney infection, blood platelets so low they said it was either me or baby who would survive. Luckily, we both did. It was a terrible experience. She was only 3lbs, had a little jaundice and needed a feeding tube. She came home in two weeks, pulled through just fine. I'm hoping this pregnancy goes sooooo much smoother. Also wishing you ladies the best with your preeclampsia",

            "answer": "Thanks ladies. I got lucky somehow and dodged a bullet. I had protein in my urine at 30 w, high blood pressure whilst at home in 40\u00b0 heat but having driven to the capital early after the two hugh blood pressure readings, its gone back down from 138/89 to 130/60. Ob thinks the heat was pushing my body too much. Be careful ladies, listen to ur bodies. Even though it might seem like I did a 1500k drive for nothing, I'd much rather be wrong and closer to my hospital.",
