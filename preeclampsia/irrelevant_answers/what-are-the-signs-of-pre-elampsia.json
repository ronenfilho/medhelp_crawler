If you are experiencing swelling in your hands and face then you may have reason to worry but even then it could just be swelling. Some other symptoms are changes in vision, high blood pressure, loosing protein in your urine, sudden weight gain.Ultimately, only your doctor can tell if you have it, he should be checking your BP and urine at every visit.",

            "answer": "i didn't notice swelling in my face when i had it. looking at pictures, i see it was there, but at the time by most noticable symptom was my swollen feet. they were huge. i had indentations from my flipflops, and they were still there hours after taking the flipflops off.My BP was high.My dr did a 24 hour urine collection to determine if my kidneys were spilling protein- they were. He also did blood work to check for liver function- my red blood cell counts were low indicating liver failure. An ultrasound confirmed that the placenta was calcifying. When he started these tests (all of which definitely indicated preeclampsia when the results came back), my only major noticable symptom was the extreme swelling in my feet. I didn't feel like my BP was high, but it was. He did the tests on Thurs/Fri and got the results Monday. He called me first thing Monday and told me i had to have a c-sec that day. By then, i had other symptoms emerge- tiredness, malaise, etc... But like i said, at the time of the tests which all indicated preeclampsia, it was just swelling.",
