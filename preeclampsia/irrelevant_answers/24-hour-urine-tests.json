    "question": "Well, I am home for the day \"peeing in a bucket for 24 hours.\" My urine has come back 3 weeks in a row w/ protein. My Dr. is worried about preeclampsia. I am a nervous wreck. I had placenta previa w/ bleeding (now corrected itself) Been in the hospital for a 3 day stay b/c I was having contactions and they had me on meds 3 days to stop them. I have been dehydrated, the first 15 weeks I was throwing up every day.. I am feeling like this pegnancy has been sooo problematic. I am only 27 weeks and terrified something is going to go very wrong. I think I am looking for reassurance and I am looking for more information on protein in urine.Any advice or stories would be appreciated..My Dr. was saying that due to my issues thus far, there is a 50/50 chance that I will be taken out of work and have Jaxson early.. I dont want him to be early, I want him to be normal and healthy. On top of that,my work has been A-holes, and I have no sick or vacation time, and I dont qualify for short term disability. I have NO idea how I will survive if I get taken out of work.. I am sooo stressed out. Thanks for reading..Laura",
