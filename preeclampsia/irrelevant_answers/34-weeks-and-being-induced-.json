I definitely feel them and they are painful but not unbearable. From a 1-10 I would rate them about a 5 maybe a 4 1/2.My Dr says that our next step is to use a balloon. To insert it in my vagina and over time it will expand and help me dilate quicker..As of right now, I have a little time to eat my breakfast and doze for a little while.",

    "question": "Back story~~So the past few weeks I have beenhaving high blood pressure and I have been in and out of hospitals because of it. The doctors were worried about me developing preeclampsia and the fact that my baby is low on amniotic fluid.. I received 2 steroid shots for my baby's lungs and got tested for GBS.After a weekend stay at L&D of being monitored and not developing any new symptoms, I was discharged and able to have my bed rest at home with close monitoring.Just yesterday at a prenatal appointment,I got the surprising news that just within the couple days I have been at home, I developed a shockingly large amount of protein in my 24 hr urine and my blood platelets had dropped lower! I was than diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and told to go to L&D right away and prepare to be induced!What's happening now~~~I arrived here and shortly after arriving I received an IV of magnesium. It has been nearly 24 hours since I arrived but now the process is moving along.My cervix was checked and the dr says the conditions are not favorable. (My cervix is high, long and closed).I received misoprostol vaginally to \"ripen\" my cervix just an hour ago.I don't feel any different yet but according to my monitors, I am having contractions already!! I can't feel them though...Daddy will be joining me as soon as he can. :)I will be checked in the morning to see if I have begun to thin and open. If I have we will probably move along to the next step of stimulating labor!For anyone interested in the induction process, I will keep updating as often as progress allows. :)",
