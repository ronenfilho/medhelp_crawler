    "question": "So I have a good friend that just had a baby and at her 20 week ultrasound she found out her little one had a heart disease and one kidney with a cyst on it. About a month ago she got admitted into the hospital because she had preeclampsia and high blood pressure. So last week at 36 weeks she had an emergency csection because of a lot of amniotic fluid. Her baby was born without ears and has spine problems. She didnt get to hold her at all cause they took her right away to do surgery on her heart and then yesterday she had another surgery for her kidney. As sad as this is im telling this story so we can be thankful that we have healthy babies and some ladies on here complain when they dont get what gender they want. Just feel blessed that your baby is healthy and that you are able to carry that little miracle.",
