            "answer": "Yes! I'm so sorry to hear you are going through this too. I had it severely with my first. It developed at 28wks and they were able to manage it until it stopped responding to bp meds at 35wks and they delivered my son via csection when my bp was 170/140. This time they had me on aspirin and calcium drom 6wks but I developed it at 15wks. My bp has only been 160/90 so they've been managing it and I've been in and out of hospital 4 times this pregnancy but I'm now 27wks and my protein is starting to increase so my dr thinks I only have about 5-6wks to go maybe sooner before my body has had enough and I'll deliver early again via csection. My understanding is, deciding whether to deliver or to try to manage it, depends on you bp how much protein and baby's immaturity. I can't deliver right now as baby's growth has been restricted and it probably wouldn't survive right now but in a week or two baby's survival rate goes up to 95% and while my bp is managed and protein is not dangerously high, baby is better off inside. I hope this information helps you. Sending you lots of positive thoughts!",

            "answer": "To keep from getting it again you need to have at least 90 grams of protein a day. It's been proven to reduce the risk. As far as I know women who do that will not get it.",

            "answer": "I haven't heard that before but thanks for the tip Kolina24. This will be our last baby as I have a 90% chance of developing it again due to the damage to my kidneys and liver now. I get preeclamplsia because I don't grow very good placentas so baby doesn't get enough nutrition and oxygen, placing pressure on my liver, which leads to my kidneys leaking protein, which all gives the side effect of the high bp. The high bp is dangerous for me as it can give me seizures and stroke so they try to manage it way before that happens, but the protein is particularly important as it gives an idea of how much the liver and kidney are struggling. I'm not sure of the effects of a high protein diet but my drs have had me on a strict low fat diet to help support liver function.",

            "answer": "90 grams of protein a day is not really good for your kidneys. You'd be spilling protein into your urine far more than you already are. With your liver the way it is you sound like you are a risk for HELLP syndrome which is why they may want to deliver early even though your BP is in check.",

My ob said its possible they may wanna go ahead and deliver.im only 29 wks today!! Ive already had my first steroid shot for babys lungs and im due for the second one at 8pm tonight.
