            "answer": "Girl I feel u. I just had my baby girl on christmas but I wasn't due til mid Jan. I got induced cuz I was the same as u in the hospital 3 diff times for 2-3 days at a time. Bp always went down like a day or two later but at my non stress test Christmas eve my bp was extremely high n they finally said ok we are admitting u n inducing :) it sucked being induced with high bp cuz I had to get a cafeter and they hurt so bad n I couldn't get up. But after they started me on those mess to start labor I had her a couple hours later. I was only 2cm when I went in then they started the meds I jump to ten in like a couple hours pushed 5 times n my angel arrived Christmas. 5lbs she's so tiny :) but the contractions did hurt ! tried the epidural n it didn't kick in by the time I had to push I could walk around right after the epidural. Good luck girl",

            "answer": "I was induced with my first and had my second natural 2 weeks ago and it is true induction is worse. But it is always better to be safe than sorry and not everyone has problems with induction so don't worry about it. Everything will be ok. As far as pain I'm not so sure cause I had back labor with my first and regular with my second and got epi both times so I can't really say there....good luck",

    "question": "So I've been to L&D twice now for high bp, but once I get there it goes down. I'm so swollen, I have protein in my urine, and when they did the 24 hr urine I was 7 pts off of the cutoff for preeclampsia. I am gaining a ton of water weight. Last night In the hospital my sons hr was high so today I had to do a non stress test, luckily everything looked okay. He's measuring a week ahead. So now I go back in two days and am doing another 24 hr urine collection. The doctor said if nothing comes up from this one we will induce on Wednesday to prevent my bp from getting worse. The highest its been is 189/117. But its been right around 140/90 consistently. I'm so nervous about induction everyone says the Pitocin is worse than natural contractions! And I know it sounds crazy but it doesn't feel real yet and as a ftm I'm scared I won't know what to do. When he needs to be changed, etc. Such anxiety! Any advice ladies!?",
