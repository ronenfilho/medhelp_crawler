    "question": "Okay well to start off i'm 19 years old and just had my identical twin girls 35 days ago (emergency c section at 34w6d due to an extreme case of preeclampsia) the last few days of my of my pregnancy I was gaining nearly 10 pounds a day! My pre prego weight was 135 and I got all the way up to 206. Now im down to 155 which makes me feel great! I hope to get to 125. everyone tells me that I look amazing and\u00a0\u00a0all that junk. But truthfully\u00a0\u00a0I don't look amazing, my body looks like its been through a war zone. I hate my body, I hate my skin. I feel ruined. My stomach is so scary looking I can hardly look at it, but yet its all I think about. I was prepared for the stretch marks. I had no idea that my skin would sag... I really think I need to talk to someone that knows what i'm going through, someone who has \u201d twin skin\u201d. I truly am getting more and more depressed about this as the days go by. I feel so alone, like no one understand.",
