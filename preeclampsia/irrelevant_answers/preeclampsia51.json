She asked if I've had any headaches I told her yea they started back up in the last two weeks and my BP has been slowly creepin up... Now I gotta get blood work and sent up to triage. I have no idea what they plan on doing but I don't wanna b here all day... I'm 36 weeks today also high risk cuz of my heart problem which is y I was gonna b induced at 39 weeks possibly sooner now I'm guessing... Idk. How early can u b induced because of preeclampia",
