He only needed 1wk of nicu and that was just for brething and feeding issues, otherwise he wouldn't have needed to be in there. It will be so special to hold your little one and you will be ok! Sending positive thoughts.",

            "answer": "Please don't stress, your baby would be fine if born now, although not ideal, your baby would be able to survive. I got pre eclampsia at 30 weeks, and delivered at 33 weeks, my little girl was only 4 lb! But she only needed a 3 week stay in the nursery until she weighed 4 lb 7oz. Pre eclampsia only gets progressively worse, so the later you are diagnosed with it, the better. Even if your situation held out for another week or two, your baby would be classed as full term. Good luck to you and baby!",
