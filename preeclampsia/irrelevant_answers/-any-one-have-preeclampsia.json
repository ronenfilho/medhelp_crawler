            "answer": "I have recently been diagnosed with it too at 32.3 weeks. Make sure your OB keeps a close eye on your urine and BP. Preeclampsia can cause strokes and seizures for mom and cut off oxygen and nutrients to baby. Headaches, elevated BP, protein in urine, shortness of breath, fluid retention, blurry vision, excessive weight gain in a short amount of time are just a few symptoms off the top of my head. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, watch your sodium intake and monitor your weight gain. Report any new symptoms to your OB. Hopefully they can keep it under control. Delivery is the only cure for preeclampsia.",
