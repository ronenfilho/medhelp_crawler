            "answer": "Hi! I did not personally go thru preeclampsia but my best friend went thru it with her first daughter. I can't tell u her whole experience but I can tell you that her daughter may have been early and only 2 lb 15oz but today she is four and so healthy and smart and the most beautiful little red headed lil lady. My point is that everything will be fine just take it easy and have faith! Not sure if that really helps :)",
