            "answer": "I think you mean thromboctyopenia? Which to answer the other poster is an abnormally low number of platelets. With preeclampsia and low platelets you are developing signs of HELLP syndrome which is very very serious and most likely why they want to take the baby early. The thing with your conditions in the gestational diabetes is the only one that really effects the baby at all. The other two are just very dangerous for you. Baby will most likely spend several weeks in the NICU but if you were to attempt to go closer to term your life could be in serious danger depending on the severity of the other two problems.",

    "question": "Diagnosed with preeclampsia thrombocinia and gestational diabetes. I'm 28 weeks Dr is saying we may have to take baby early as in in the next week or so. Anyone ever had all 3 conditions in one pregnancy? And if so was the baby healthy? I'm also measuring 6 weeks too bIG. I go for ultrasound nst and consult with high risk tomorrow. My regular ob says to be prepared for them to admit me and possibly take baby same day. I have 2 biological children and 3 adopted. Any advice??",
