            "answer": "This is my 4th child and seems like everything keeps going wrong. My HCG levels were almost at non viable early on. Bleeding and cramps. They got that higher where it needed to be but it's been hard with him ever since. Now I have this and don't know what I am doing. I feel bad because my husband and mom are stuck doing everything. They also both work full time. I watch tins of TV and am on FB a lot. But I'm not only bored out of my mind, I am super uncomfortable. So glad this is my last child. I could never handle this again. You must be an extremely strong woman. Kudos.",

            "answer": "Thanks but this is my last as well! Second baby, second time going through this nightmare, no more. I know what you mean, my mum has my toddler because my husband has to keep working so I feel really guilty and such a burden. Abd i cant help but think if i gad this amount of time off work under different circumstances I would make such better use of it! Its just such a tough journey, but I keep thinking this is going to be the last time I'm going to experience this so I'm going to force myaelf to enjoy the not so bad days. I truly hope things get easier for you. Hang in there!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 26 weeks. I am 28 weeks tomorrow. Bed rest is killing me but I know I have to do it. I have a very bad back and neck as it is, so laying on my left all the time really isn't working well. Any tips to make it easier?\u00a0\u00a0Being so early on, I have a long ways to go before I can have the baby and be off bed rest. Help!!!",
