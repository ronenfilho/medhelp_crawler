Was told if its the same next Tues then they are going to go ahead and take the baby! Has anyone else been diagnosed with preeclampsia? I had it with my first born 17 yrs ago and had a really difficult time giving birth and almost died. They let me go two wks past my due date with her though before inducing me. I've never went early and am nervous but trying not to be stressed out. I'm actually 36 now and this is my fourth baby! Oh and I've also been diagnosed with gestational diabetes this time.",
