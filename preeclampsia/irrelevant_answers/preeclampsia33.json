            "answer": "I had preeclampsia with my last baby. I went in for my check up, urine showed high protein levels, blood pressured was kind of high. I was 39 weeks along, due 5days not dilated. The Dr was concerned, said she wanted to talk to other Dr and get a 2nd opinion. She called me about an hour after I left the office to meet her at the hospital to need induced. They tried a cervadil induction, which is inserted up near your cervix to soften the cervix and progress dilation. It stays in 12 hours. Unfortunately it didn't work for me and I didn't dilate at all. I ended up needing to get a c-section because my blood pressure was getting dangerously high. Everything worked out well though and my little man is healthy and now 8months old",
