            "answer": "Generally they check for it now but chances are it wont show until you are further along. Plus they wont do anything for it until youre closer to having the baby. Ill be 37 weeks on thursday and they think I have it but they wouldnt check until I was full term. Just try to relax and keep that bp low. The cure to eclampsia is delivery. Unless you start having severe symptoms like unbearable headaches, severe swelling, frequent dizziness I would just take it easy. They will monitor you closely until youre further along but again no need to freak when they cant deliver for you this soon. Im sorry youre going through all of this but its best to stay calm for both of you",

            "answer": "With my first pregnancy I was diagnosed at 20 weeks their really isn't much they can do .just monitor you. If to severe they put you on bed rest or rest with feet up. When they deliver they will give something to help your blood pressure not to rise. Mine was mild pre eclampsia so they just magnesium sulfate in a drip for my blood pressure not to rise.\u00a0\u00a0Kept me in the hospital 7 days after having baby.",

            "answer": "Don't stress yet momma. I had it severely with my first pregnancy at 28wks and blood pressure meds got my baby another 7wks. This time I got it at 18wks and have just come home from hospital and they are still hopeful we'll make it to 32-35wks. I knew I had it both times though coz I was sooo sick. First time the original plan was to get me to 38wks. Just do everything the dr tells you - bed rest, meds, water and stay optimistic!",

    "question": "I'm 29w1d and my doctor is running tests for preeclampsia. This comes from two elevated blood pressure readings. I have no idea if they have found protein in my urine or not. I've had some touch and go swelling in my feet and ankles (a few times in my hands, that was minor). At 26 weeks I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.I'm kind of freaking out. I just cried in the bathroom at work for 20 minutes.",
