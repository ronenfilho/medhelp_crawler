            "answer": "I had it severely with my first but bp meds, aspirin, and calcium got me to 35wks when I had to deliver by csection as protein was too high, bp had stopped responding to meds and baby stopped growing. This time I was considered high risk from the start and they started me on aspirin and calcium from 6wks in hope I would grow a better placenta but it was picked up again at 15wks. It wasn't as severe this time but because it developed so early we told to just take it each gestational milestone at a time and expect lots of hospital stays. And we have. I've had 5 different hospital admissions now, had my bp meds numerous times, and my body nearly gave in at 27wks when i went into preterm labour 3 times but all of my scans have been great and all of my symptoms managed well and it looks like I will make it to a csection at 36wks. I consider myself very lucky to have such a great dr but this will be our last as we have a 90% chance of it happening again now we've had it twice. However, we were told that we'd be very unlicky to get it this time as having it in your first does increase your risk in a second but the risk is still only like 15% and even then your odds improve if you had it really late in pregnancy. I hope these odds give you some peace of mind. Wishing you and baby all the best!",

    "question": "I'm only 15 weeks with my second baby but I had pre eclampsia with my first son. My midwife wasn't very on to it so it wasn't picked up untill I was in labour. I'm guessing it cant have been too bad as I went full term and went into labour myself at 39+2. None of the doctors at the hospital explained to me what it was. When i got pregnant this time I got really worried and started researching it. Have other mums had similar experience and what happened the second time around. was it earlier and worse ? What are some things I should look out for and will they monitor me closely this time?",
