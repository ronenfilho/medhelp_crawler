He did say though that if it was preeclampsia, i would begin to get worse as my due date nears. i have about 10 weeks until my due date and the closer i can get to it, the better off we'll all be.",

    "question": "hey everyone! i know i haven't been on in a while but i wanted to ask everyone to keep me and baby Evan in your prayers. Last Friday I went to the ER because i didn't feel right and i ended up staying for 4 days. it turns out i have pre-eclampsia. it's in it's mild stages so we caught it early and are taking precautions to prevent it from getting severe. i am back at home now but i have many restrictions. i'm on modified bed rest, low sodium diet, i see my OB twice a week, i take a 24 hour urine twice a week, and i will now be seeing a high risk OB. although this is a scary thing I have to say my doctor is doing a wonderful job and is keeping a great eye on me. at first she was afraid i would not make it to 34 weeks (she can't deliver babies before week 34 due to the fact that there is no NICU in the hospital she delivers at) but now that we have things under control she is more hopeful that i'll make it. i'll try to keep everyone updated as much as possible. thanks everyone for everything!",
