I have my fingers crossed that you can stay well enough for your bubs to be in there as long as possible.I developed severe pre-eclampsia very late, and quite suddenly in my last pregnancy. I was on drips to lower my bp and had magnesium sulphate to prevent seizures. Thankfully it really only effected my labour and 2 days after. I'm currently pg with 2nd and so far so good no PE but ob is doing a lot of testing!Good luck. Stay in bed. Watch a lot of tv and try to relax. I hope bubs can stay where she is for a few more weeks.Sarah",

I have no experience with Pre-eclampsia however as a mother of two with both pregnancies being after I was 35, I had complete placenta previa in my second pregnancy. My first heavy bleed came at 26 weeks at which time I put on bed rest. I suffered through loss of my father one week into my bed rest while I was still grieving the loss of my mother just 8 months prior. With the exception of getting special Dr. permission for funeral arrangements etc. I followed the doctors orders to a tee and managed to keep my DD, Riley,\u00a0\u00a0inside until 34 weeks at which time she was born by emergency C-section due to my 3rd very heavy bleed. She was born at a very strong 4 1/2 lbs and spent only 1 week in the NICU! Today she is 6 months old and doing very well:-)adgal is very right...Medicine has made very incredible advancements in this area although I know that knowing that doesn't stop the worrying.As hard as it may seem sometimes, try to stay positive! We are thinking of you...good luck with your journey!",
