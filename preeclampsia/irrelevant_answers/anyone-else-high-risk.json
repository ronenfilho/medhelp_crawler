    "question": "I am 32 weeks pregnant and a ftm. My doctor has classified me as high risk due to my blood pressure. My blood pressure has been stable through out my entire pregnancy with the help of medicine but they are making me go to the doctor every week to get an ultrasound and keep an eye on my fluids and make sure I dont get preeclampsia or go into preterm labor. Anyone else high risk or in a similar situation?",
