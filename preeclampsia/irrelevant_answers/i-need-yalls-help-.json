    "question": "I went to my appointment about 2weeks ago and my dr took a urine test and about 4hours later she told me that she found a little protein in my urine which was leaking from my kidneys, she told me to rush to the emergency room to check and make sure everything was good , i went to the er. They checked my urine again and they said they didnt find anything. My question is how did they find the protein in my urine at my appointment but not when i went to the emergency... also i been having a pain on my right upper side right uder my right breast and i been getting nauseous and been having abdominal pain and feel my blood pressure high at times and all those are symptoms for preeclampsia... do yall think i should tell them to do another test just to be sure or should i just let it go ??
