            "answer": "What more important , the baby or the man who really seems like he dont care about you? If he cared he would not stress you at and make you cry. I mean 37$ he cant get that in less than a 3 hours of working time. Not being rude but in my saying , HES A LITTLE ***** who is immature. Hes saying stuff to you thats actually him. Bipolar people dont last with regular people. And sweetheartcan find another man. That wbby will never know his or her real father left unless u find the man for u and ur baby before he or she is 3 . They dont remember past certain ages. Do whats best for u and that baby. Think about it that heavan sent angel allready has a heart beat. Its allready a big life in this world. Stop crying and think bout how happy that baby will make u once he or she is in your arms:) JUST PRAY AND U WILL BE HAPPY. :)",

    "question": "I am 10wks pregnant and am so stressed out because my boyfriend was mad at me over paying for my mani/pedi which was 37 dollars. He asked me for the money and I gave it to him but said next time just tell me that you do not want to pay. He raised his voice at me in front of my 8yr old son and told me I'm taking shots at him and he doesn't have to do anything different. The next day he comes home from work and starts yelling at me saying that I'm immature and selfish and that my attitude is disgusting. Then he gets all in my face screaming not to ever ******* talk over him like that and don't ******* tell me what to do! He has done this before. He never hit me but it scared me both times and I am very stressed with a high risk pregnancy I had preeclampsia the first time and almost died. I told him to leave and now he moved back with his mom. I don't even want to have the baby now I can't stop crying. I know that no one can tell me what's best for me but I need someone to give me guidance or share their experience. He has been disloyal talking to women on partylines and on the internet, he expects me to cook for him and doesn't help me clean the house without arguing or getting mad at me. His father was not good to him and he has anger issues but I hoped it would get better but I think it will get worse. He says everything is always about me and I don't acknowledge his feelings but I'm pregnant and honestly I don't care about his feelings if they are anger over 37 dollars! Now that he is gone I still feel like **** and I really don't want to have a baby that I have to raise away from their father because he is abusive and needs anger management. Please Help!",
