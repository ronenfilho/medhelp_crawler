They state that burning is not on their list of side effects, so I must have had an adverse effect to the drug.I have read lots of differing views on this drug, a very mixed bag of good bad and indifferent.There have been many cases of side effects causing death, and putting women in a vegetative state, because the midwife has not administered it correctly to the patient, and by people misreading what another midwife has written, when they change shifts for instance.I am trying to find out if what I felt was because this drug was not administered correctly, which I am pursuing with the NHS Tust at present.Also my veins at the site of the injection raised up when they gave me this drug, as my partner witnessed.I just need to know why they did not check anything at all, given that they did not check my reflexes etc after these reactions, especially if as they say, I should not have had these reactions per their list.The only lasting effects from this drug is how it has affected me mentally.I still can feel the burning sensation all over my body and the way that my heart was racing and I thought that I was about to have a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0This will stay in my brain for ever.",

            "answer": "I'll try one more time.It is unfortunate that the staff did not tell you in advance that you may feel a sensation of heat during administration.\u00a0\u00a0Even when administered properly, its my experience that the vast majority of women experience this.\u00a0\u00a0Some feel it much, much worse than others.\u00a0\u00a0We continue administering it anyway, although sometimes it is slowed down to try to minimize the effect a little.\u00a0\u00a0Often, slowing down the loading dose doesn't help, though.No reflexes need to be checked (although checking reflexes IS part of assessing a patient with pre-eclampsia as a baseline).\u00a0\u00a0The reason that reflexes are checked as a part of Mag sulfate administration, is that decreased reflexes are a sign of a build up of Mg to toxic levels in the bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0However, it takes quite a long time to get to this point--hours, at least of continuous administration.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, Mg levels are drawn every 6 to 8 hours during administration.Mg sulfate can be QUITE irritating to the vein.\u00a0\u00a0Often, we put cold cloths over the vein site to minimize the pain during the loading dose and shortly thereafter.It should be quite easy to ask for a copy of your medical records and see what dose you were given.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the load is 4 to 6 grams given over 20-30 minutes, followed by 2 grams an hour, to a max of 4 grams an hour.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the standard, usual dose given to everyone.I do not routinely warn any patient of possible cardiac effects.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, I have not often seen a patient complain of such effects, unless they become panicky about the burning (heat, flushing) sensation.\u00a0\u00a0If a patient has been on Mag sulfate for quite a while, they can complain of chest pressure and discomfort, in which case an EKG is done to be sure they are not suffering from myocardial ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0But this almost never happens unless the pt. has been on Mag for many, many, many hours and has an abnormally high Mag level.You are very lucky that you did not progress to develop eclampsia (the onset of seizures) after you did not receive an adequate administration of Magnesium.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a few women seize with eclampsia, and in some cases their babies have died in utereo during the seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time, even untreated, pre-eclampsia will not progress to eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0But unfortunately, we cannot predict who will or will not progress to this dreaded outcome.You were very fortunate.\u00a0\u00a0You are obsessing about something that is far in the past now.\u00a0\u00a0You have a healthy child.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is to stop obsessing about this and look towards a bright and happy future with your child.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt you will be successful in suing the NHS unless you can prove grave damages, and that you were given an improper dose of Magnesium.I wish you the best, and will have no furthur response for you.\u00a0\u00a0I've given it all I can, as an experienced labor nurse of 30 years who has administered this drug, and others, for many, many years to very high risk patients.Best of luck to you and your familiy.",
