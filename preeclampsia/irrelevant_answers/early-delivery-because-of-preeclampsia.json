I was already taking high bp meds but started to get on the high side and was getting more protein in my urine.

With my second I had preeclampsia and was induced at 37 weeks with no issues. With this pregnancy I'll be perfectly satisfied if I have the beginning of preeclampsia at 36 weeks...it really depends on the severity of preeclampsia and how far along you are.",

            "answer": "My experience: this is not to scare anyone bt to share my story. I had pre eccplamsia with my first. I noticed swellings on my entire body so went to the doctors and they found my blood pressure being too high, and they found 3+ protein in my urine. So I had to be admitted to the hospital. This was at 36 weeks and 6 days. The doctors wanted to wait it out and see if my blood pressure would go down with meds bt it just went higher. Think it was 190/110 not sure now though. So I had to be rushed down to labour ward to get induced or I would have a fit. Thankfully I was 37 weeks the next day so baby would be born full term. I got induced which was the worst experience for me. Due to the stress my bp wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0go down and baby was very distressed and his heart rate was going lower and lower so I had to have an emergency c-section. But thankfully as soon as my son was delivered my swelling had gone down and I lost 10kg in a matter of hours and my sons heart rate returned to normal. My bp also returned to normal however due to losing a lot of blood during c-section I got anemic so had to take tabs for that. Im thankful that doctors did a great job and my son was healthy! :D",
