            "answer": "I had my son at 36 weeks and 3 days and I also suffered from preeclampsia. However mine came all of the sudden, I went in for my first weekly appointment and my BP was too high, they made me stay and lay on my side for about 15 minutes, took my pressure again and it was still high. Had me pee on the cup and then lay on my left side again for another 15 minutes and no change. Since I had my appointment on a Friday they made me collect my pee for 24 hours and had me go back on Monday to turn it in so they could test it for make sure it was preeclampsia, the doctor also prescribe medication over the weekend to help. So I went back Monday to turn it in and then again my pressure was through the roof, and they made me do the whole resting on my sides and all that. Oh, I forgot to mention that she also basically put me on bed rest for that weekend, which was really hard for me to do with my then four year all and all the stuff that I usually do during the weekend, like cleaning and all that good stuff lol. So to make this long story short, I went into labour the next day on Tuesday early in the morning. My son was born weighing at 4 lbs 13 oz, he didn't need spacial care, he passed all the tests that they do on them like sugar, jaundice and even the car seat test, because they thought he might be way to small for a regular infant car seat. He did awesome, we stayed at the hospital for two days due to my BP and also that he lost 5oz and were a little worried about that. On last thing, when the ob came to check up on us the next day after having my son, she told me that in fact it was preeclampsia and that they were going to induce me the Thursday of that same week because of it. I'm glad my son and my body decided to just go ahead and do it all in its own. I hope this helps. Hang in there and try to relax as much as you can do you can at least make it 2 more weeks or longer to make sure the little one can go home along with you ;). You'll be amazed how strong they are even of they look so fragile. God bless you and your bundle of joy!",

I had my first at 32 weeks because of preeclampsia and my 2nd at 37 weeks. With my first we both nearly died, especially me. I fought for my life in a hospital bed for 2 weeks. That was 11 years ago and my daughter is healthy now.... yes, we are alive, although it was not an easy or pretty ordeal. Low sodium and relax, ask your doc what else you can do to slow the preeclampsia, sometimes blood pressure meds can help.",
