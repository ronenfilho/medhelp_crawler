    "question": "Yesterday I had a doctor's appointment. Everything was fine (BP etc) but I woke up this morning with swelling of the hands and my eyes very puffy. My feet are of course swollen but I know that's from the extra weight and standing up for a long period of time. Is this normal or could it be preeclampsia?",
