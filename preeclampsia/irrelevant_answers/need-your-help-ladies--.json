People are going to have money to shop for gifts anyway, but let them know early so they can put extra money aside if u do it in december and I dont think november is too early. It will give you enough time to save up extra money to get all of the things you need instead of havin it so close to ur due date and getting yourself frustrated trying to get all those things in a short amount of time....especially if money is tight.",

I ask because that's a money crunch month and call me selfish all you want but I want my baby to get nice gifts lol .. my bf said to do it before Christmas so everyone still has money to spend, but my sister said to wait till after Christmas because everyone is going to forget about my shower trying to prepare for Christmas..but after Christmas everyone is going to be broke lol and I can't have it late in jan because I have a history of preeclampsia and with my luck I will end up going in for a c-section earlier then planned then I'm stuck with having no shower .. so can someone give me some of there input thank you :)",
