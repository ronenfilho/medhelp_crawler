    "question": "I'm scared. Lately my blood pressure has been borderline high.And within the past week to two I've gotten this sharp pain at like the base of my skull and very top of my neck in the back. And when I get that I have to stop everything I'm doing, sit there to where it fades enough to get up and go lay down. It's so bad I feel like I might pass out if I move. That's why I wait until it passes enough before I stand up to go lay down. And it comes with super bad back pain and leaves me with a headache after the pain goes away... it only happened once. But then it happened Friday night and just a little while ago.. Idk whether to call my doctors office or to wait until Friday when my next appointment is.. I'm worried this could be preeclampsia... help ladies please I'm getting worried. I'm 35w6d",
