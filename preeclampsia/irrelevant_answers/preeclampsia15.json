Preeclampsia can go from 0 to 100 real fast and can be harmful to you and the baby....this is my 3rd time having it and I'll probably be induced tomorrow as well. Stay positive and prepare yourself. This happens to the best of us.",

    "question": "Any body dealing with gestational high blood pressure? What is helping? I am always 90/60... In like six weeks I have steadily rose to 130/85 ish. They are not saying it's a problem yet since it hasn't been 140/90 at the doctors.... But I see those numbers at home at times. And I have suddenly gained almost 8 pounds in a month. I am gonna be 35 weeks.. My fingers get pretty swollen lately and my neck/face... I get sharp pain all the way across under chest basically bra line area that radiates. Everyone passes it as Rib pain but I don't think rib pain should be that terrible. No idea what to think. And I am anemic and I am extra short of breath many days :/ and I'm typical weight so no idea! Sorry so long. Any experience or advice close to share? Thanks",
