            "answer": "You have to have protein consistently in your urine to have pre eclampsia. Every woman will have some protein in there, but to have that diagnosis requires a higher number. So it's most likely something else. Take whatever meds you've been prescribed and try to be patient while they figure our your real diagnosis.",

            "answer": "Not every woman has protein in their urine..protein in urine is abnormal and not every pregnant woman has abnormal urine. You can also have pre-eclampsia without protein showing in urine. I had pre-eclampsia and it only started with really high bp, headaches, and blurred vision. There was no protein in my urine until 36 weeks but my dr. Had already diagnosed the pre-eclampsia before\u00a0\u00a0because of the other severe symptoms. I had pre-clampsia with my first child as well so I knew most likely I was going to get it again, and I did. And yes my Dr had me induced at 37 weeks because of it and gd.headaches are linked to pre-eclampsia and I have never heard otherwise. My Dr told me headaches are a key symptom to pre-clampsia. If you do have pre-eclampsia you are considered high risk, and from what I know most physicians almost always induce early to avoid those risks. However it depends on your symptoms. If you continue to have headaches, high bp, pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, blurred vision and protein in your urine then you have it for sure and they should be inducing you which then will also give you magnesium to avoid seizuring. But sometimes you can just have high blood pressure because of anxietu, stress or pain, so maybe your Dr is waiting to see your variations and if your symptoms persist. Try not to worry and stay postive. I'm sure everything will turn out fine. Good luck and congrats on your LO.",
