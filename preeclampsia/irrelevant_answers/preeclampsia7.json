Pregnancy is rough on your body and everyone's body reacts differently. There is nothing you did to bring it on. Just try to eat healthy and be sure to give your body enough rest. I was induced with both and it's really not so bad. My first I was induced at 35 weeks and my 2nd at 37 weeks. Both of my girls are healthy and never had any issues at all because they were early. I am now pregnant with my 3rd, only 6 weeks along, but have it in the back of my mind that it will happen again. I am just trying to eat healthy and get exercise on a regular basis. I have my fingers crossed it won't happen again but I won't be surprised if it does. Good luck to you. Just try not to stress yourself out because that is no good for your mental or physical health. Have faith that everything will be fine.",

You did NOTHING to cause this. It is completely uncontrollable, skinny people get it too, just being.overweight cab factor.into it, the same way it can factor into gestational diabetes, which theyve tested mefor several times as well, even though theyre negative in my blood work. Don't get upset, just try and relax, and trust your doctors, they are gonna take good care of you, and would not induce or deliver early if they thought the cons outweighed the pros. Cheer up love!",
