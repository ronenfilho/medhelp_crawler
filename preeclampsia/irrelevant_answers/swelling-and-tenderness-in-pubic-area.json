    "question": "Not my vagina, thank goodness. But I have a lot of swelling in the area above it- right around the pubic bone. It is tender to the touch too. I recall\u00a0\u00a0this happened at the end of my last pregnancy, and I was very aware of the lingering swelling there after having my c-section. But, I am only 18 weeks! Did anyone experience swelling (water retension??) there? I am very paranoid about having preeclampsia again. I took my BP this morning- it was nice and low- 108/70.",
