I am currently dealing with it now and my dr is just trying to get me to 37 weeks without it turning. I am going to be 37 weeks on Thursday and am currently in the hospital getting monitored because last night I was sick with dbl vision, vomiting, headache, bp 150/102 And much more. So as long as nothing happens between now and Thursday I should be having my lil man on Thursday :-D can wait.",

Magnesium oil spray to rub on your skin is recommended - better absorbed than by taking pills.\u00a0\u00a0It helps bp. They give you injections of it if you get too dangerous like having seizures etc but don't worry that is a rare complication that is almost never allows to get that far in Western countries. So plenty of rest for you, magnesium oil, and do have a c-section birth plan just in case as I was shocked by mine having to have it very suddenly and all my plans and hopes went out the window.\u00a0\u00a0I now wished I had read up on c-section just in case to prepare myself.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't a bad experience but I just wasn't prepared and didn't get the bonding etc I had wanted because I forgot to ask for it (eg I didn't Breastfeed my son until he was about 8 hours old even though I was able to and could have.\u00a0\u00a0I just didn't think about it! )",

I've been monitored for it since I got pregnant and had to do 2 24-hr urine tests since I had chronic hypertension (high blood pressure prior to pregnancy-controlled of course)... the only cure for it is delivery of the baby and it can be very, very serious in some women and threaten both lives if left untreated. .. it sounds like your new doctor is on top of it.... you dont always need a c section with preeclampsia and most women are induced and have vaginal birthsI have known many women who have had to be induced because of preeclampsia and had vaginal births... only 1 needed a c section-- my aunt. Her 7th pregnancy she developed severe preeclampsia at 22 weeks... and had to have an emergency c section at 24 weeks since she got severr toxemia.. they tried keeping her pregnant as long as possible but had to operate because they both almost died... she was very close to getting eclampsia- thank god she didnt... your doctor wont let it get that bad and since your soo close to the end anything that signals preeclampsia and they will induce.1 fingertip is about .5cm dilated",

They sent me to hospital and the consultant said I was on the verge of developing it and gave me some options to either go and have my bp checked every other day at hospital or be induced on my due date. I chose to be induced.if there was cause for huge concern I'm sure you would be in straight away they wouldn't hang about for yours and your babies sake. So I'd try not to panic and wait for your doctor to confirm it. However if your leaking fluid I cant imagine them leaving you to long due to risk of infection. Speak to your midwife and I'm sure she will give you some reassurance. Best of luck x",
