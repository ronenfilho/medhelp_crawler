            "answer": "Funny I always have protein in my urine since every check up and my OB never mentions it to me. It's great to hear that everything is OK :-)I have my next appointment on the 25th October, so I will be 28 weeks 4 days. I went in to the hospital to meet my midwife last week and my little one is still swimming around in there, she shows absolutely NO sign of settling into a position as of yet. We shall see next week. In my first pregnancy, my daughter was head down quick early and remained that way, but even at this stage for all of us, our babies still have time to move, some are late ones :-) I am under an enormous amount of stress -\u00a0\u00a0a big diff. to my first pregnancy and maybe that is the reason why my little one is also highly active as well.Keep us informed!",

    "question": "Yesterday I had my 28 week check up. I go in every 2.weeks now because of my risk of preeclampsia. So I measured right at 28 weeks. I had trace of protien in my urine. Which they expected. My blood pressure is stable for the time being. Aubreys heartbeat was 158 and that is normally where it is. I go in at 30 weeks for my next appt and a growth ultrasound the day before my babyshower. I am hoping that she is not breech anymore at my u/s. If she is I will be looking.at doing a version to flip her. Which I really dont want to happen.",
