            "answer": "HI...I do have PPCM, and I also had preeclamsia with it. Part of the reason it went a week with out being diagnosed was the factthat my preeclmsia was so bad I had to have an emergency c-sect at 35 weeks. When my kidney began to fail and my symptoms didn't subdise they looked at everything. finally a week later of still being in the hospital and not\u00a0\u00a0being able to walk or breathI was diagnosed, they coded my room and my O2 levels were in the 70's. I was diagnosed with it then. My EF was 20% and now 7 rs later it is 45%.My suggestion to you is look further into it. Get your ECHO reports, even though you recovered doesn't mean you didn't have it. Esp with the preeclamsia you had. There is an awesome website that is strictly for PPCM and womwn wanting to have more children there is also a DOC on it and he is able to answer all the question. If you would like it, pls e-mail me.I think it does warrent futher investigations, but it may just be that you are watched by a cardio, with your OB. There a many people on theboard who have gone on tohave more children and are pg now.A lot of women do recover in the first 6 weeks to 6 months, so it is could be the case with you.Having said that, it may have been the meds. Did they ever do a BNP test??amyif you want my e-mail, I'll give it too you.",

            "answer": "Wow...I've never even heard of PPMC.\u00a0\u00a0I have high BP and had to switch from an ACE inhibitor to a beta blocker before trying to get PG 6 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed on Aldomet as well and it was awful.\u00a0\u00a0My BP was actually higher on the Aldomet than it was if I took no BP meds!\u00a0\u00a0I mean really high...like close to the reading you had.\u00a0\u00a0I felt really awful on it, too.If your echo came back normal and your OB/GYN and Cardio think you'll be ok this time around, I would go for it.\u00a0\u00a0Just because you had pre-eclampsia with the last pg doesn't necessarily mean you'll have it again this time.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your Dr. about other BP drugs that are safe during pg besides Aldomet in the event it does happen again.\u00a0\u00a0I took Labetalol (beta blocker) and hydrochlorothiazide(diuretic) during my entire pg and my daughter is perfectly fine.\u00a0\u00a0My BP was also really well controlled.Good luck to you!",

    "question": "I am concerned that I may have had PPCM following my second pregnancy and wondering what your opinion is with my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I will give a little history.\u00a0\u00a0Five years ago my daughter was born at 36 weeks due to severe preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I was induced as soon as my blood pressure was up.\u00a0\u00a0It ranged from 140s to 160s over 90s to 110s.\u00a0\u00a0Everything went fine during the delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed on Aldomet following her delivery.\u00a0\u00a0When I arrived home, I began to feel extremely tired (feeling as though I would fall asleep at any moment) and more swelling in my feet and ankles (I was already swollen due to the pregnancy).\u00a0\u00a0I also felt as though my heart was enlarged (this might sound crazy, but it did) and I also had a very slow heart rate (40s to 50s).\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure remained elevated with at least one time reaching 190/120.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I do not recall feeling short of breath postpartum, although I was during the pregnancy, which I assumed was normal due to the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I do not recall these symptoms lasting very long, maybe 2 weeks at max.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, everything returned normal and I was weaned off the Aldomet when my pressures began to reach normal levels (apprx 1 to 2 months postpartum).Two years ago, (3 years after delivery) while at an annual checkup, my doctor noticed a 1/6 murmur and sent me for an echocardiogram.\u00a0\u00a0This was basically normal with an EF of 65% and with trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\u00a0\u00a0Everything else was normal.I want to have another child, but am afraid that this might have been PPCM.\u00a0\u00a0I have mentioned this to my OB doctor and he looked over my echocardiogram and listened to my heart and heard no murmur.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that my symptoms were common with use of Aldomet and not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0I still do though.My questions then are:\u00a0\u00a0Are these symptoms consistent wtih Aldomet use?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anyway to know if I did have PPCM without having an echo back then?Thank you very much for your insight into this.\u00a0\u00a0I am very nervous about attempting another pregnancy with this thought in my mind.",
