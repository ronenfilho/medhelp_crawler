            "answer": "There's risks for everything. Do not let other ppl's experiences scare you. Your dr is very well capable of administering an induction and I'm sure he wouldn't tell you to do something that was bad for you and baby. All you have to remember is to breathe and what helped me when I was induced was focusing on something in front of me like the clock and I would breathe as relaxing as possible and i would tell myself \"this won't last forever, I'll have my baby soon\" over and over. And if you EVER feel.uncomfortable it's your right to tell the dr or nurses. If you're blessed to have a doc like mine he will try to make it as easy as possible. I've had 4 inductions and will be haing a 5th with this pregnancy. And remember to read up so you know what will happen and ASK QUESTIONS if need be. Ask the dr not anyone else. I hope my advice helps don't be scared and remember to rey to relax you can't be in labor forever. God bless you and the baby :)",
