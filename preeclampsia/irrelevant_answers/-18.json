            "answer": "This is ine thing they should be checking for each appointment its the main reason they collect urine and test it with the dip stick to check for proteins. A minimal amount of protein in the urine is notmal in a pregnant women due to the kidneys being over worked. But a large amount is not. They would have more than likely said something if they thought your blopd pressure was high over a long period of time. A high blood pressure is anything greater than 140/90.\u00a0\u00a0They tend to monitor very closely because preeclampsia is no joke. But you should definitely tell your doctor your concerns. Especially if your experiencing swelling in your face or hands",

    "question": "I had a really bad kidney infection in January so Im on an antibiotic but I noticed my right kidney has been hurting so I went to the dr today and I had blood in my urine. They said its probably just a kidney stone. Then they did an ultrasound to check on the baby well my placenta has calcium spots on it, which she said is the placenta preparing for labor. Im only 33 weeks, she paused for a long time before saying if it was normal. There was a lot of white spots. Well,I was looking up a little more about it and google says it usually happens this early when you have preeclampsia. Ive had tons of problems with swelling, dizziness, constantly feel like my blood pressures up. Could blood in your urine mean preeclampsia? Does anyone know anything about the calcium spots on the placenta. I didnt really think anything of it until I started googling things. I have an appointment Thursday but Id just like to see what you all know about it.",
