            "answer": "have you called your OB? you could be retaining salt for some reason too.. try cutting out the salt over the weekend, and hopefully that'll help. & you may not be suffering from any sinus/allergy trouble.. but they could still be flared up. my mama has SEVERE sinus attacks every year, and hers always flare up a few days before she even gets sick..either way, whether it goes away or not, get in touch with your OB asap, and if it gets worse just go to the ER. I'm not saying it's super serious, I'm just not one to take chances ya know?prayers & good luck!!",

            "answer": "Yes those are signs of pre e. Even though in most cases it isn't diagnosed until late in pregnancy it can still happen early. I was diagnosed with it with my first at 23 weeks and ended up delivering her at 28 weeks stillborn. There were other complications with my pregnancy for her to be stillborn, but pre e should not be ignored. I would call or go get checked out.",

    "question": "My face has been a little swollen for the past 2 days, especially around my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I am not suffering from any sinus or allergy issues.\u00a0\u00a0I read that this may be a sign of preeclampsia, but preeclampsia is not diagnosed until later on in pregnancy (I am almost 13 weeks).\u00a0\u00a0I am currently at the beach, so it possibly may be just fluid retention from the heat.\u00a0\u00a0I have increased my water intake.\u00a0\u00a0Does anybody have any thoughts or experiences with this?",
