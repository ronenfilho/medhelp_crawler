            "answer": "This is my 2nd pregnancy with it. Bedrest, aspirin, calcium, and bp meds have bought my babies a lot of time! With my first I developed it at 28wks but managed to get to 35wks before my liver and kidneys started to struggle and the protein levels were too high. This time they had me on aspirin and calcium from 6wks but I developed it again at 15wks and unfortunately by 27wks my body had had enough and went into preterm labour but luckily they were able to stop it three times and I'm still pregnant at 29wks :) I'm sure its all been explained to you so I wont go into it but basically I just don't grow very good placentas so my baby's tend to do ok because they steal everything from my body but my body really struggles. With my first I had 3 high risk hospital admissions, and this one I've had 5 so far, but every admission has got my babies closer to full term. It makes for a hard pregnancy but it is completely doable if you have lots of support and do everything the dr tells you. Wishing you a smooth pregnancy!",

            "answer": "@kt6 I had never heard of it when I was pregnant with my first so I just thought my excessive weight gain and excessive swelling of face and nad hands was normal. Then I started to have extremely bad headaches and would be blinded by whitespots. I went to me dr and my blood pressure was 170/140 rather then my usual 110/60 so he immediately did a urine test and when it came back with extremely high levels of protein he sent me straight to the hospital. This pregnancy was a lot more mild but I suspected I had it again from my first experience. I had a headache for a week that wouldn't shift, I had stacked on a lot of weight all of a sudden, and my legs were swollen at wouldn't go down with rest so my dr checked my bp and sure enough it was 160/90 so I got to do the wee test and hospital trip again.\u00a0\u00a0With my first I felt so much better within hours of delivery but my liver function tests were still not quite right 6mths after. This time, my dr doesn't think I will be as lucky due to the damage to my liver and kidneys so recovery might be a bit longer, this will have to be out last baby, and I wont be able to go on oestrogen based contraceptives as they could effect my bp. But everyone is different so its important you develop good communication with your dr.",
