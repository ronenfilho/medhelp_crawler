            "answer": "Preeclampsia is determined by your blood pressure being high, protein in your urine, and swelling. Those are the three major factors. Many many pg women swell naturally. Especially the legs and feet because of the wt of the baby. The blood flow cant really move back and forth like it is supposed to. Water retention starts to happen. If you are worried about preeclampsia, monitor your blood pressure, get a urine analysis. Most importantly, talk to your doc. He will have all the answers ;o)",

            "answer": "If your blood pressure is 20 points above your normal, and you have swelling of hands, feet and/or face, and you have protein in your urine,\u00a0\u00a0that would give a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Other symptoms to watch out for are severe headaches, and blurred vision. If you believe you may have pre-eclampsia, drop in at your OB office, and ask for a urine check, and a blood pressure check. This will tell them quickly if there is a problem. You do not need to wait for your next appt. to do this, nor would it be a good idea to wait if you have these symptoms.As far as the asthma-This may sound wierd, but try eating very small meals. When you get to the 3rd trimester, there is less room for everything, including your lungs. When you eat a big meal, it crowds out your breathing space. Also, maybe you should ask your Dr. for a nebulizer for the albuterol for the rest of your pg. This will deliver it more slowly, and give your lungs more opportunity to respond to it than if you just take the two puffs. Your Dr. can also prescribe a peak flow meter, and a pulse oximeter to help you monitor your breathing. You can then record these readings, and go over it with your Dr. at each visit. This is much more concrete for your Dr. than \"I can't breathe\".",
