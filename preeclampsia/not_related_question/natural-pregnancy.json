This time I am fairly bound and determined to go pain-med free. I'm not going to feel right calling it a natural labor, the way it's going. I've already had three doses of prostaglandin gel to attempt to induce.But breathing exercises and acupressure helped me loads during my first labor. This time I want to use the labor ball, walking, and the tub as well. And distraction really is key, that's why breathing exercises work.My doctor this time around is awesome. She has been doing everything she can to help me with my \"natural\" labor, despite my bordering on preeclampsia. Finding the right doctor can make a huge difference.",

I really feel like I'm going to have put in 9 months of working hard to be healthy and make everything right for baby why mess it up at the end... I watched this really great documentary an I wish I could remember the name ill post it if I remember... but a quote I that really got me was that\"society is making women feel that they can't birth children\" with all the medications I just would rather be a tough cookie for this life event and this way I'm still doing the best or baby :)",
