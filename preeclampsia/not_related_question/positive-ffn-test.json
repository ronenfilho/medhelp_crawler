            "answer": "I don't know.... But if they gave you steroid injections it's usually in case they expect to deliver soon and want to boost baby's lungs & organs. Dizziness, headaches, and elevated BP can all be signs of preeclampsia(sp?) so they might be preparing just in case you need to get baby out. But you might get past this episode and go full term... I would talk to your healthcare team to be sure about anything..... Hope you feel better and and baby is good! :)",

            "answer": "I started having contractions at 30 weeks and also had a posotive ffn test. They gave me the steroid shots for babies lungs and told me i was done with work..my job consists of alot of lifting. I continued to have contractions afterwards quite often especially when i over did it a little to much. They told me that a negative test obviously wouldve been more helpful as it would have meant there was a 90% chance he wouldnt come early. The positive test just tells them that there is a small possibility he could come early but its not anything they can know for sure...well im 39 weeks now and still going strong. I worried and stressed for weeks that i was going to have him early and now im a week away from my due date lol",

            "answer": "I hope you feel better and make it full term! Its so stressfull worrying about them coming to early :( my doctor had assured me that even if he had come at only 30 weeks he would be fine and after the shots it would be even better as one of the biggest worries is their lungs. But they had said that babies born that early is alot more common than anyone would think and not to worry. They just cant release them until they weigh 5 pounds...which that would be so hard not being able to bring them home right away! Goodluck to you",

            "answer": "Well hopefully if you do, you can get both steroid injections first. They really do work. My daughter born at 32 weeks is a testament of that.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's a care by case basis on when a baby can go home too. My son came home weighing 4lbs. 11 oz (born at 36 weeks) and my daughter came home when she was 4lbs. 10oz. The good news is at 34 weeks they can start nipple feeding almost right away. I hope the best for you!Oh just had an antenatal steroid shot yesterday because I am 30 weeks and have previous premature births. Be prepared to feel more of the dizziness and nausea for the short term at least. I had really bad insomnia last night too, which is atypical for me.",
