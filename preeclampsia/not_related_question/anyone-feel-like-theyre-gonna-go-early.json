My son was 4 days overdue and i was induced with him and then my daughter came on her due date. But with all these early aches and pains i'm getting with this one i'm sure s/he is going to come early. I'm 30 weeks today so in another 6 weeks it'll be nice to see the little one he he. I go for my midwife appointment and then i have to go for a scan sometime between now and the 8th July as i have to see a specialist on the 8th July as they are keeping a close eye on the ladies that had previoulsly had smaller babies. So i'm really looking forward to all these appointments and i suppose they'll give me a good idea if s/he is going to make an early entrance.Good luck to everyone, not long now!!!!!",
