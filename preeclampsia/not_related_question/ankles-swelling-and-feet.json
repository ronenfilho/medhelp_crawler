    "question": "I am 28 weeks today. For the past two weeks I've noticed more and more swelling in my feet and ankles some days it will go down a little bit but not a lot. I do work and I'm up and down all the time. While I'm home I put my feet up and tried soaking in Epsom salt, I've tried ice and heat nothing seems to help. Today I noticed that my legs are starting to tingle and hurt as well as I've noticed some spots being glossy. Should I be worried? I never had this issue with my first so I'm a little worried... please help.",
