            "answer": "My suggestion us to drink a whole lot of water and eat prunes to poop and eat carrots and cucumbers to detoxify,they don't/can't really do anything for it but you need to release the toxins in your body, my mom got it with me then discovered this intestinal movement formula from her chiropractor and took it with her other three and never got it again cuz it kept her toxins out, if you have a naturopathic store around you you can get out there its different from a laxative but if your not comfortable with it anyway then yeah,carrots and cucumbers, lots of then clean yourself out! Good luck",

During labor they gave me meds through an IV called magnesium sulfate that prevented me from having seizures. It makes you feel really out if it and sick. The worst part for me was after I gave birth I had to be flown to another hospital and they gave me\u00a0\u00a0medicine to get all the fluid off my body. It's definitely a sucky disease to have, but as long as the docs keep a good eye in you, you'll be fine.",
