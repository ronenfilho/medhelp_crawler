            "answer": "You should try your best to stay off your back. When you do, the weight of baby and the uterus slows the return of blood to your heart, and reduces the blow flow to the baby. That means your baby is getting less oxygen and fewer nutrients. I put pillows in front of me and behind me right against my back to prevent myself from rolling to my back in my sleep. You shouldn't be on your back for more than 15-30 minutes.",

Yes we should try for our left side but our babies aren't gonna come out weird if we end up on our backs. I end up all over the place. I'd probably end up sleeping on my head if I thought it'd make me comfortable.",

            "answer": "Octoberpumpkin is correct. In early pregnancy is fine to sleep on your back,\u00a0\u00a0but as pregnancy progresses it's not a good idea. The uterus presses on the main vena cava.\u00a0\u00a0This causes decreased blood flow back to your heart from your lower body.\u00a0\u00a0This can cause you to get dizzy, as well as decrease oxygen and nutrients to the placenta. I'm 26 weeks 5 days and I always find myself on my back. I have been putting pillows behind my back to help keep off.",

            "answer": "my midwife told me it isn't a big deal. more important that your sleeping then how and if the weight of the baby and uterus were causing your body distress you would wake up or move in your sleep.i know however it is a larger concern with women with preeclampsia since there is already a stress on your circulatory system you dont want to add to it. by all means confirm with your doctor but ive noticed everyone gets different advice from their dr.about this subject. im 22 wks and still small so my midwife said once i get bigger laying on your back wont be comfortable too. your body knows what to do.",
