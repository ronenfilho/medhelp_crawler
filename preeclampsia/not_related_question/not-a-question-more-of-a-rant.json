My cousin would go to the ER for every little thing because her head hurt, because she felt nauseous, because her back hurt and so on.

I think some women exaggerate and don't understand that it could actually backfire like in my cousin situation.",

I was just seen Tues for my normal appt and was almost a 1 and 0%.I layer there in pain for 2 hours still having contractions and she checked me again no change so she told me I was just dehydrated and told me to drink 1/2 gallon of water and go home n go to bed.I'm so frustrated with the ob dept cuz I've been up there so much with contractions and there's always done excuse. Ligament pains growing pain dehydrated etc. I'm to the point Idk if I will want to go there if I'm really in labor for fear that they just gonna give me an excuse and send me home",
