            "answer": "When I had my appt with the genetic counselor last week it was mostly just informative. They went over my test results from my blood work and told me what range they should be in and what complications could arise if my levels didn't balance out. (preeclampsia for me) Then they told me all of the tests that they could do to get a more definite answer and any risks that were involved. I also had an ultrasound scheduled for that day and so they explained what they would be looking for and that they'll monitor me every other week fire the next month or two. Good luck tomorrow, try to get some sleep tonight!",
