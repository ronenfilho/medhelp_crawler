Pretty sure it was my nerves! Just try to breath and get yourself relaxed before they even\u00a0\u00a0call you back. I know it's hard but eventually you'll be ok. My first appt this time mine was a little high but I breath in and out before hand and get relaxed and it's been fine since.",

She isn't even my ob and ill be seeing my ob soon so I decided against taking it until I consult with my doc and see what she thinks. I have no advice for you though I wish I did! My hands sweat and everything! Its bad. I just try to keep distracted.",

Because of my nerves so they would wait 10-15 min for me to calm down and come check it again and BAM no high BP :-) ask them to do that",

    "question": "So, the last couple times I've been to my doctor appointments my blood pressure is a little high. My doc said to cut salt. The thing is I don't eat anything salty or use it when I cook. Baby prefers sweets. Lol. I Have a blood pressure monitor at home and it's always low or perfect. I'm almost positive it's my nerves and worried if baby is ok. Any advice or tips on to calm myself and my nerves before my appointments??? Thanks ladies!",
