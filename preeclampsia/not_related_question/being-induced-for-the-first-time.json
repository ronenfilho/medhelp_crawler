            "answer": "I was induced on 4/7 this past April. My Dr used a cervidil which is inserted near your cervix to help soften ur cervix. I was 39+2weeks, a fingertip dilated and near preeclamptic. Well the cervidil stays in 12 hours, the next morning around 6:30-7am the Dr checked my cervix-NOTHING!! I had failed to progress, in fact I was so closed that they couldn't even break my water!! I ended up needing a c- section because my blood pressure had been way up because of the preeclampsia that they didn't want to chance any farther induction. My little man was born at 10:23 am and I'm currently 22 weeks with another little boy, hoping to go natural.",
