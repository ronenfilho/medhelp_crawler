No matter what I ate or how much I exercised I still am excessively putting on mass amounts of weight. It's so hard on you mentally and physically so I feel for you girl. You're not alone and the struggle is real. I tested negative for GD and other possible health reasons that could be affecting my weight. I am almost 35 weeks and too embarrassed to even say how much weight I've gained. Just know that if you're healthy and so is your baby that this is temporary and this too shall pass. :)",

If you already started out a lil heavier, then you don't need as many extra calories.Your baby will take what it needs from your body and your body will sustain, especially if you already have a little extra weight,\u00a0\u00a0and of course prenatals help add nutrients to your body for you.",

It's been so hard on me emotionally and I feel for Mothers that go through this struggle. Elle - it's a relief to hear your story also. I hope I drop this weight quickly.Hang in there Mason, you're so close to the end. I'm sure you look great and no one else sees your weight the same way you do. (I pray that's how I'm viewed also)",

I know it's normal to be worried about losing the weight and the struggle after having our little ones, but I have faith that we will lose the weight ( sooner or later lol! ) I think there will be some reassurance once the baby is born and you have your body back to yourself and see it changing back to somewhat normal. Just think you will prob drop 20 lbs after delivery, water weight, feeding, ect. I'm trying to think that anyway so I don't feel so bad or discouraged,\u00a0\u00a0it will all be worth it right?",
