She's pushing her little toes directly onto my bladder 90% of the day, though so I knew it before he even told me loland\u00a0\u00a0@meNmy3Cs I had preeclampsia with my son so I was scared to have gone so long without care. I went 5 weeks without a choice, though as my Dr was on a holiday vacation for 2 weeks. When I went to my last appointment, they decided to tell me he had been called away to an emergency meeting and that they didn't have time to call and let me know. Would have been no big deal had I not been in such pain I couldn't walk and unable to contact my Dr because he was out of the office, on top of having to borrow my MIL's car to go 30 miles away at 9am... :/",

    "question": "I went to the Dr for the first time in 7 weeks (was trying to switch drs but nobody would take a transfer at 25 weeks). Well, I got an ultrasound. My baby girl is measuring a week ahead and weighs 1lb 12oz. She's breech right now, which is causing serious back problems for me, but she's growing well. My son was 5lb 5oz at 37+4, and I'm 25+4 now. He said if she goes to term, she should be at least 7lb 7oz. I hope so!On a side note, I've only gained 3lbs but Dr doesn't seem concerned because she's growing well and I'm obese anyway. I might not hit 300lbs like I thought I would! :)Just wanted to give everyone an update and give some positive vibes to the forum!:)",
