Of course, if your water breaks, don't bother calling, just go in.",

Its not a constant feeling of being dizzy it just comes and goes as well and sometimes i get so dizzy that i feel like im gonna faint and get blury vision, But it dont last long. Im due on the 16th of June and i dont think i can last til then im way to uncomfortable and dont like the way i feel sometimes not to mention i also have depression and its not helping at all. I wish they would just induce me today. I mean is there anyway that i can get them to? Im already dilated to a 1 and i am 36 weeks and 3 days.",

Even if you think you could be going you could still be pregnant a week later. The only surefire way to know you're in labor is if your water breaks, if you're contracting consistently and strongly or if you're 100% effaced and over 5cm dilated.",
