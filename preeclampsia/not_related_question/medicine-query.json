            "answer": "I'm not sure what you are asking.\u00a0\u00a0What are you needing medication for?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had any complications with this pregnancy?The duphaston is a synethetic form of the hormone progesterone.\u00a0\u00a0This is typically prescribed during pregnancy if there is a need for it to help sustain the pregnancy. Typically when there is a risk of miscarriage or low progesterone levels are noted.The Justprin (aspirin) I'm not sure about.\u00a0\u00a0From research, I see that some people feel it can prevent preeclampsia but I have NEVER heard about it being routintely prescribed in early pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Unless it possibly has to do with a disorder of some kind.The folic acid is standard procedure, this vitamin is essential to the health and development of the baby.If *I* were in your shoes, I would go ahead with the duphaston and the folic acid, but would question the doctor about the use of the aspirin and the reasons behind prescribing it.This information is just based on my own personal knowledge and my 8 pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor or even in the medical field, but perhaps this information can help you make a more informed decision.CassieCo-Cl Pregnancy 18-34",

            "answer": "My doctor (a reproductive endocrinologist) prescribed the .81 aspirin in early pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It is done very commonly in IVF, to help the baby implant or prevent blood clots or something.\u00a0\u00a0It is not dangerous, and is not related to whether someone has had an abortion or miscarriage.Progesterone is also commonly prescribed by reproductive endocrinologists, and very commonly prescribed in Europe for any pregnant woman.\u00a0\u00a0This is to prevent the uterine lining from shedding early in the pregnancy and taking the pregnancy with it.\u00a0\u00a0Although a lot of women don't need it (their progesterone levels are fine without it), it doesn't hurt anything to take it.I tend to think the first doctor was being a little careful, but that since the second doctor gave you that baloney about aspirin only being for someone who had had an abortion, the first doctor is the better doctor.Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0None of these things will harm you to take during pregnancy.",
