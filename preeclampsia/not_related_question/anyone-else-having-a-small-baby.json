            "answer": "I do! I've been being monitored for about 3weeks. He's healthy and growing. But because he's small they doing all these tests. I'm 35weeks. So far they said they want to keep him in. No need for me to have him early.",

            "answer": "I'm right there with you girl! They have been monitoring him since 31 weeks. He's barely been growing in percentile but still in the teens. Barely reaching 5lbs. They did final growth check (36+3) on Thursday and baby still not up to par. Also my Bp has gone up significantly. I have preeclampsia and have been put on bed rest. They called me yesterday and I'm scheduled for Monday morning induction which will be 37 weeks. But they assured me that baby is in great health and everything checks out fine. He will be full term so it's okay. I'm kind of relieved it's scheduled so I can plan to it but that's only a couple days away so not much time to prep.",

            "answer": "I went in for 34 WK ultra this week and she suddenly measured small (4.5 lb) and low fluid. Was in hospital all week for monitoring, but home now. Was given steroid shots in case we go early, but hoping for a few more weeks still",

            "answer": "Glad Im not alone here! Last weight they gave me was 3lbs 10oz back at 33 weeks and this time at 35 weeks he didnt even give me a weight and just sent me straight for testing. He did say he was measuring around 32 weeks though. It just bugs me that my baby has always measured on the smaller side & now my doctor made everything sound urgent. Congrats on baby coming soon kristina! Hope everything goes smoothly for you :-) And hopefully your little one can stay cooking for a bit longer jcemily!",

    "question": "Had a doctor appointment yesterday and doctor is now concerned with how small baby is. He sent me from his office over to L & D for NST, blood work, urine analysis & an ultrasound..everything came back normal\u00a0\u00a0as it has been all along but baby is just small. Hes also breech. Doctor says if the baby doesnt gain enough in the next two weeks hes taking him at 37 weeks. If he grows he'll leave him until 39 weeks as long as hes breech still. If he grows & turns the right way then he'll let baby come naturally. So much to think about and consider out of nowhere, its hard not to stress. Anyone else having a small peanut??",
