    "question": "I had a question for the veteran moms who worked during pregnancy. I did not work during the last phases of my last 2 pregnancies, so I have no reference for this. I started a new job on monday, and it requires me to stand for most of my day. My ankles and lower legs are so swollen it's scary looking. I have NEVER seen any part of my body swell like that ever. It looks like I have grapefruits planted on top of my feet, or like my legs are pouring out of my shoes. My hands or face isn't swollen at all. It's so painful. I was wondering if anyone else had severe swelling and still had to work, and what you did to relieve a little of it. It's pretty bad, I mean, it looks like both of my ankles are broken. any advice??",
