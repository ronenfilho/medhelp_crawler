    "question": "My Dr. Told me that my bp is too high 151/100 and that I may have gestational diabetes. I went for my 3 hr and felt so dizzy it was ridiculous. She made me take zofran 30minutes prior to the procedure so I could keep down the sugar drink because the time before I threw it up. Then my Dr told me I have +1 protein in my urine. She asked about a yeast infection. I have none and if I had a uti. I dont feel like I have one. She told me that next week I have to do a 24 hr urine collection to see what's up. If I'm still leaking protein and my bp is not lower then she said she may have to place me in the hospital. I had a lot of baby movement before I saw her but since coming home for the last two days I have not felt much baby movement. My stomach feels hard and when I stand I feel so heavy like I'm carrying a rock. I'm 31 weeks 6 days. I'm really worried. Any ideas on how to decrease bp and sugar?",
