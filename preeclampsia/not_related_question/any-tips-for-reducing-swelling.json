            "answer": "I get some swelling at 34wks 4d. What works best for me is going for a light walk then getting my feet up above my heart and drinking lots of water.It sounds like your Doctor may be concerned about pre-eclampsia. The retention, rapid weight gain and high blood pressure are symptoms. Did they check your urine for protein? Are you having any issues with headaches or your vision? When is your next check up?I don't want to freak you out, but my Doc is concerned because my BP was a little high this week. He told me if I get a headache that won't go away after I take a Tylenol that I need to call him right away. He also said if I have spotty or blurred vision I need to call.Good luck & best wishes!",

    "question": "Hey everyone! I'm at the 32w mark and having a bit of a problem with swelling in my legs, feet, ankles, and hands. I have been using epsom salts daily, compression socks, putting my feet up and drinking lots of water. And I still cant get the swelling to go down. I also got a support belt that is supposed to help, and it feels good, but I cant fit in any shoes at all. I am at a loss on what to do and was hoping someone could give me a suggestion that I havent tried yet.Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!! :)",
