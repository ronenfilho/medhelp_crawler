I know what your saying tho a lot of people on here only comment on things that have to deal with drama or active labor. But then again this is an app full of pregnant women so what do you expect we need to rant and rave about something to women who are also feeling thr same way. But just remember this is a forum non of us (unless we are a licensed medical professionals) really have the correct information or advice to give you. Your better off researching it online from a site or calling your dr/midwife for advice. We can only give you info from what we've experienced or have read about ourselves.",
