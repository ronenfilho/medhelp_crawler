    "question": "I was just wondering if anyone wanted to give any advice. I am 29 weeks and 5 days and for the past 3 days my feet have been so swollen and I have been having belly pains above my uterus. My feet aren't sore and I they don't feel tired. I also haven't had that much sodium intake so I don't think its that. It never really goes away, it's there in the morning and there when I go to bed. I just had my 28 week check up like 2 weeks ago and I do not go back for almost another 2 weeks. All my test have come back normal for blood work and blood sugar and anemia. So, the question is should I call them and ask to come in earlier? Second question, could something have happened in this short time (2 weeks) like hypertension or toxemia that I don't know about and without any warning signs during my last appointment?",
