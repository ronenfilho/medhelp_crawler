It ***** if this is what my boobs feel like now I can't imagine what breastfeedings going to be like with someone constantly sucking and pulling on them. I've been having contractions too well they stopped last night and none today but for 2 days I was in horrible pain and outta no where just stopped. So I'm not really sure if I'm going to go into labor soon. In a way a really want to I'm so miserable inside and out I can barely walk bc my feet are so swollen they feel like they're going to explode, same with my stomach its stretched so tight its hard as a rock. My hands and face are swollen. Im constipaped nauseas and to top it off I have a horrible skin rash called PUPPS on my already uncomfortable enough stomach where its like these little pimples that are so itchy and sensetive spread all over you. They get infected and burn and tear open. But in another way I want to deliver on my due date the 12th bc his birthday will be 11-12-13\u00a0\u00a0and I still need to put his clothes away. I'm so exhausted and I feel like gravity is torturing me.",
