            "answer": "Well I guess I posted this in the wrong week, I can't believe it's already thursday...So I'm 32 weeks on Saturday, and man, pregnancy has been rough the past two weeks...I'm having to quit my job as a cashier at a grocery store because I just simply can't do even a 4 hour shift anymore. Standing on my feet for that long just makes me sooo tired, cranky, swollen, and in pain that it's not worth the little bit of money I'm making.I've been super super tired all of the time, I was sleeping like 8 hours at night and then a 1-2 hour nap during the day but last night, holy cow I kept waking up needing to reposition, then pee, then I'd be super hungry, I got 5 hours of sleep, it's freaking early as hell, I don't have to wake up for 4 more hours but well, I'm awake!! BLAH lol.Baby is also dropping I think, she's making me waddle, punching me in the hips, and her butt is back down to being by my belly button again.My house is coming along nicely though at least :D lolAs for baby shower I was just recently in Alberta and my friends there through me a surprise baby shower which was super exciting because I didn't think I'd get one, so yay!",

            "answer": "I like that name....SOOO much better than Mary or Mary Jane LOLI'm so excited for you...by this time tomorrow you will be a married woman!! YAY!!!As for me, I don't have my appt until tomorrow. It was supposed to be today but I rescheduled becuase today was the only opening they had this week to come put my carpet in my livign room!! WOOHOO!\u00a0\u00a0So now I am sitting here waiting not so patiently for them to get here and get started.At my appt tomorrow my doc is going to manually check to see if she is head down or still breech and will also begin doing cervical checks weekly now.He told me at my last appt that he doesn't feel I'm going to go past mid- MAYBE-late august.\u00a0\u00a0I realized the other night that mid august isn't but 3 1/2-4 weeks away. OH MY!!I really want her to stay put until ATLEAST 36 weeks though.\u00a0\u00a0But as long as she is healthy I'm ready for her to come whenever she is.I havent' had so many sharp shooting pains in my cervix, but I've toned down on the level of physical activity I've been doing now that I've got most everything painted.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still having BH.\u00a0\u00a0I even have a few in the mornings before I even get out of bed!!\u00a0\u00a0I feel a LOT of punches/kicks inside my hips.\u00a0\u00a0It's so low and far inside my hips that sometimes I'm afraid if I sit up to fast I'm gonna squish one of her body parts LOL.I'm still having a lot of left hip pain.\u00a0\u00a0It's usually worse when I get in bed at night.\u00a0\u00a0I can sit at my desk or move around and it doesn't bother me as bad.\u00a0\u00a0But after I've sat in bed for a bit it REALLY starts to hurt.\u00a0\u00a0It makes it really difficult for getting comfortable as well.\u00a0\u00a0I've also been getting a good bit of lower back pain if I'm on my feet more than a short period of time.Time is gonna fly by this next month or so, I, too, have a ton of stuff going on. Tomorrow my youngest DD is turning 7, next week my oldest starts band camp which will be from 8-1230 M-F for 3 weeks, then she goes to 3 night time practices per week for 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Aug 5th is my youngests 2nd birthday, my bday is aug 18th.\u00a0\u00a0Plus my weekly doc appts and my DH and oldst DD have appts that alternate weeks (like she goes one week and his is the next) so it's going to be busy busy busy. Plus, after the carpet is installed I have my living room to put back together, then my dining room becuase we shoved all the LR furniture in there.\u00a0\u00a0Then I gotta clean clean clean so that I'll have as much done as possible before this little girl makes her grand enterance!!I'm gonna try and post some before and after pics of my living room.\u00a0\u00a0It's not completely finished but I'm so proudo f the work we've done I wanna show it off.\u00a0\u00a0DH and I have done all the work ourselves, the carpet will be the first thing we've paid someone else to do.\u00a0\u00a0Actually *I* have done most of the work on my own since I've been pregnant becuase DH works a lot.\u00a0\u00a0check it out and let me know what you think!!!",

I cannot wait.Well, my next docs appt isnt until Aug 6 so about 2 weeks from now and I am hoping everything will be good and he will check for the baby's positioning and stuff like that, I have no idea what to expect though.....I have been having so many dreams about the baby, about him being here but in every single dream, I do not have any recollection about having him, like no labour or delivery...weird huh? And in my dreams I am always asking Shawn (my boyfriend) what happened, and if I got the epidural.....etc..I hope that isn't a bad sign!",

            "answer": "Congrats on the wedding waitn!!! :) You must be so excited.I'm 32 weeks now, and my ultrasound went great. Baby is measuring at 3 pounds 15 ounces, (or 4 pounds) and is currently head down. It feels like she's going to fall out of my belly button though, so that hurts a bit, but nothing else to really complain about. My next appointment is this Monday, and I pray that I've gained some form of weight. I've been able to eat fairly well for the past week and a half, so I'm hoping that it shows I have.We were supposed to have some people come work on the roof of our house, but they keep canceling because it looks like rain. So I'm hoping they do that before too much longer. The roof in the living room and bathroom fell in not too long ago, and it desperately needs fixed. They're just SOOO slow. Haha. I have no patience. Plus when it rains it leaks everywhere so blah. I voted we just demolish the house but alas.My family decided to do a small shower for my sister and I this August 1st, so I'm looking forward to that. I love when my family gets together, so it should be great. Hope everyone else is doing well. :)",

            "answer": "Well ladies as of today I am 30 weeks and 4 days pregnant =0) Less than 10 weeks to go before I get to meet my second son! I went to my Dr's appt on Tue and my blood pressure was 130/70 and I finally got my lab results and everything looks good so as of right now I do not have preeclampsia just yet =0) I am now on weekly appointments though so that my Dr can keep a close eye on me just in case I do develop it. Also I will be getting another blood test done in either 1-2 weeks to make sure that all my levels stay down and I'm not developing preeclampsia. Baby's heartbeat was very strong as well (I always seem to forget to ask how many bpm).My hubby and I are going to try and get the nursery started this weekend, but who knows how that will go lol. I'm starting to stress about getting everything ready for the baby before he arrives since I have sooooo much too do still, we have almost all the baby items so we are not going to have a baby shower for this lil guy, I'm kind of sad but it is what it is, also my mom just got laid off and she is going to buy us our baby furniture so I told her not to worry about the baby shower, and as for hubby's mom she doesn't care about that were expecting so we wont be expecting her to buy anything for our lil guy.One more thing I'm just waiting for hubby to get off of work so we can go baby shopping =0) I LOVE shopping for my lil guy it's so much fun, after this round we only have a few more things to get and we will be all set (except for the nursery).Congrats waitn on the wedding!!!",

It feels like my feet are bruised and hurts to walk.I love being pregnant but I can't wait to have my body back and not be in constant pain.He asked if I was ready to be done working. I told him I really can't afford to quit yet but we'll discuss again in 2 weeks at my next appointment. He said he would write the note anytime if I can't wait another 2 weeks to call him.The packing of my apartment is going VERY slow. It took me 2 hours to bubblewrap 15 picture frames. There all 10x13 or bigger. We have some really nice frames that we don't want to get dinged and scratched while in storage. I got part of the kitchen dishes packed. We only have FIVE days to have everything packed and be out of here so we have 2 days to clean and do a walk through. I am also doing a yard sale next friday and saturday.After packing last night I started havng cramps and the sharp pain in my cervix but not as bad as before.
