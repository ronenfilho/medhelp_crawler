No cravings, sickness,\u00a0\u00a0etc. My friend said the same and had her baby a few months ago and said it was much easier and less painful than everyone made it seem, so easy birth doesn't necessarily mean bad labor. She had gestational diabetes too. I've gone this time thinking it is what you make it. I said if i dont think about getting sick, etc i wont and i didnt. Fingers crossed birth goes the same for all of us.",
