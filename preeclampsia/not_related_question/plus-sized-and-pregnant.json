            "answer": "The great this about being plus sized is that you don't have to gain much weight at all. I was 198lbs and my hospital told me not to put on more then 20lbs. However no one told me this with my first and i ate whatever and put on 37lbs but lost it all. The downside is you are more at risk of developing complications so you have to watch your diet and make sure you're getting enough of the right thing. As this is my 2nd time with preeclamplsia my dr has put me on a special diet and I feel great and baby is growing great so far. Definitely talk to your dr about any concerns you have. Good luck!",
