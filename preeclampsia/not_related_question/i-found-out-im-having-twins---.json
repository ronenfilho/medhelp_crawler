            "answer": "I has twins with my first pregnancy the development is the same for multiple pregnancies as it is with singletons. There are some great books out there for things that differ in a multiple pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0vs. singleton pregnancy. Things like higher taste of preeclampsia, premature birth, etc. I'm glad I invested in one or my twins would have came at 26 weeks in my bathroom instead of 31 weeks due to preeclampsia .\u00a0\u00a0Most women have no problems, but may end up on bedrest. The book I, bought really helped prepare me\u00a0\u00a0and made me recognize when something want right.How that helps! Look on Amazon for some pregnancy books specifically\u00a0\u00a0geared towards multiples!",
