            "answer": "Having protein in your urine during pregnancy is a symptom of preeclampsia. Which is something that effects some women (usually in their third trimester) and can also cause swelling of the feet/hands/face and high blood pressure. If you do develop preeclampsia you'll have to be on bed rest and most doctors keep you in the hospital until your able to deliver. So they do the 24hr urine to try to catch it early before you develop the worse signs. I'm on bed rest at home as I have the high bp and swelling in my hands and feet but no protine in my urine yet. If I do start to get that I'll be hospitalized until I can safely deliver my little princess. No worries though. It only effects 5% of women. And the 24 hr urine is routine.",

            "answer": "I totally understand. This is my first baby so I worry about every little thing lol. If they do diagnose you with preeclampsia and they put you on bed rest like I said most drs keep you in the hospital until delivery. Usually 37 weeks. And you can only get up to use the bathroom and shower :/\u00a0\u00a0which is not fun lol. My Dr took me out of work and I sit at home with my feet propped up all day. I have to go to the Dr every week to be checked for protein and if they find it I'll be in the hospital laying in bed for the next 5-6 weeks.",

            "answer": "Yeah they kept me over night a couple weeks ago to do a second 24 hr urine and I thought I was going to loose my mind. I'm sure everything will be fine. My mom had it with me and that increases my chances of getting. But as long as little one is healthy I'll do what I have to. She's a chunky baby and weighs more than she should so as long as she keeps growing ahead of schedule I'd be safe delivering as early as 35 weeks. If she stays the whole 40 she'll be close to 8.5lbs lol",
