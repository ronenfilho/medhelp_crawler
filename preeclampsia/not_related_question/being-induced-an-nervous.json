            "answer": "I was induced on the 29th, on the 31st at 4:59am I had my lil boy. when I went in I wasn't dialated or effaced whatsoever, so they started me with cervidil, 12 hrs later they took it out and checked me, I was only 1cm! cervix still high up and everything. but apparently I was having contractions every 2-3 minutes but I wasn't feeling them. after they took out the cervidil they started pitocin, I was getting along pretty good for quite a few hrs ( I wanted to go all natural ) contractions still 2-3 mins apart. I ended up with extremely bad back labor :( it felt like my lower half was ripping apart. So I opted for the epidural, about an hr and a half later I was in heaven lol. 4 hrs after receiving the epidural it wore off on half my body, by that time my contractions were so intense I couldn't even move! so they had to give me more. they also had to shut off the pitocin at that point cos everytime I got a contraction my baby's heart rate would significantly drop :( my doctor was already discussing with the anestisiologist (sp) about a csection.. thankfully my baby wanted to come on his own, after an hr of pushing I gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy(:try your best to focus and BREATHE ! I was stubborn , but when I did do that it helped. like above said, everyone is different and so is every labor. try to go in as relaxed as possible, and keep in mind labor may not go the way toYour want! goodluck Hun, Wishing you an easy and safe labor! keep us updated",

            "answer": "Well my water had broke, but i was 4 Weeks early. So they started me on pitocin to get things going. I was 1cm already and i have to say the contractions were painful. I heard the pitocin makes it worse rather than natural labor. When i hit 2cm i asked for some pain meds lol. It lasted like 10 minutes unfortunately :(\u00a0\u00a0 and at 4cm i got the epidural. Maybe i just don't handle pain well haha. But i was also throwing up with every contraction and on a magnesium drip for preeclampsia and it makes you feel like you have the flu. So i wanted to feel better and so glad i got the epidural. So my water broke at 630am Monday morning and i had my son at 348am Tuesday morning. That's not too long to be in labor! And i pushed for like 20 min. My nurse told me some people can be in labor for like 3 days when being induced, but since you're already dilated i'm sure you will have your little one pretty quickly too :))",
