            "answer": "It might be related to high blood pressure. How's your bp? I was given magnesium when I had to have c section with preeclampsia. I remember they kept asking me if I could see clearly.. Maybe it's one of the side effects. But being on it generally makes you feel weird. Id ask your doctor, maybe its nothing serious and just a temporary side effect.Sorry you didn't get to hold your baby yet. Hope he/she is doing OK and you'll get better soon. Good luck!! And congrats!!",
