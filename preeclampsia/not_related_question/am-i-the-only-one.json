            "answer": "Talk about pains and aches. I had an awesome pregnancy with my first, with my daughter it was like I didn't even know I was pregnant except of the big belly. With my second, my son, it was so painful, I suffered from sciatica and it hurt so bad, I couldn't even get out of bed or get up once I sat down. I had never felt pain like that and then towards the end I was diagnosed with preeclampsia and was going to be induced but he decided to come on its own. Now with this pregnancy, I had nausea pretty bad the first trimester. And now that I'm 26+ days, the baby won't stop putting pressure on the right side of my ribs, I can't breath right and it gets super uncomfortable and the sciatica is back and with my 20 month old running around is worse. I still have way to go, so I just try to take one day at a time. At least your close. Good luck! God bless!",
