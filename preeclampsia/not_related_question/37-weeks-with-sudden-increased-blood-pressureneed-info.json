I've recently started swelling I'm my feet and occasional my hands so he's concerned about that being a sign of increasing blood pressure but I won't really know more till Friday. I've only gained 20lbs and actually considered on the small size but since baby boy been growing on track that want a concern. I just want to spend up the dilation process so I can have him naturally.",

    "question": "So I had abnormal blood work earlier on in my pregnancy not sure why but being that this is my first pregnancy and I'm just 20. It means I'm high risk. So docs been monitoring my closely. Everythings been great baby boy getting bigger everyday already 6lbs 18.5 inches long. And always active. Yesterday I had a doctors apt and my bp was elevated. Doctor says if it doesn't go down baby boy will need to come asap. But I haven't dialated at all. If my bp doesn't go down they'll induce. So I'm wondering what worked best to get you ladies dialated on your own??? He's head down but I haven't dropped yet really. I'd just rather dilate naturally rather than through meds which doc says if the meds don't work then I'll need a c section. However I'm hoping my bp can stay down and everything goes naturally itself but I'm worried a little.",
