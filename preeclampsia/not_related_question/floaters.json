            "answer": "I know what you're talking about. I usually see lights when my body is stressed or getting a migraine. I've been going to chiropractor my whole pregnancy until I stopped at 35 weeks. I'm 37 weeks & the lights are coming back as my warning that my body is under stress again. Basically it's my neck & I have a hard time laying on my left shoulder. It pulls on the nerves at the base of my skull causing stress resulting in me seeing lights or streaks of light. Thankfully I'm going to the chiropractor tomorrow for a massage & adjustment which will do the trick.",

            "answer": "I was told the same thing about preeclampsia, but my doctor found no other symptoms as well which is good because we don't want that. When I see the lights, I also know it's a good time to slow things down, drink water, & ice my neck making sure the ice pack is at the base of my skull for 20 min. That darn hormone relaxin really does a number on our bodies. However I was having migraines & seeing lights before I got pregnant & my chiro always said it was my atlas vertebra causing all my troubles. He, along with my massage theropist were able to get it to all stop until recently. Maybe try getting a massage & have them work specifically on your neck, that's what mine does & it's amazing. She'll release so much tension & seperate the nerves that I actually see a light show while she's working on me, but then it all goes away after the massage.",

I noticed mine happened when I was rushing to get ready in the mornings or when I needed to eat. I literally would start seeing stars! \u2728\u2728 in front of my face. It has gotten better but I had to really slow my movements. Good luck!",
