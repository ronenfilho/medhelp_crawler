            "answer": "Keep your sugars level and you'll be fine. The only ones who end up induced or with c sections usually are the ones who completely ignore the diet plan and instructions so their sugars and blood pressure get super high and stay that way. Gd is nothing to worry about as long as you get over the whole food issue. A lot of women complain about not being able to eat what they want.... you actually can as long as it's in way smaller portions and it's not all the time. A brownie a week isn't going to cause you cause you any harm but if you're chowing down every day you'll hurt yourself and the baby. You mostly have to remember that no matter how hungry you get, you are not eating for two. The only extra you need is an extra baked potato each day in the third trimester. Everything else is a mind over matter issue. Listen to your doc and dietitian.\u00a0\u00a0They're a big help when it comes to keeping yourself level.",

            "answer": "I have type 2 diabetes my whole pregnancy and my baby will be almost 9lbs if I make it to 39 weeks. I'm having a c-section but it's because of a previous c-section and a hernia operation I had, nothing to do with me having diabetes. If you have GD it will, no matter what, cause your baby to be bigger cause the extra insulin you create leaks through the placenta which causes baby's heart to thicken, which causes them to grow faster. Their body not their organs. So they still have to stay in until full term. This will happen no matter what because it's very hard to control your sugars while pregnant an according to my fetal cardiologist, if their isn't some thicken in baby's heart then you were diagnosed wrong. As long as you watch your sugars and stick to the diet you are given, your baby will be just fine. On the larger side but just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Also if you have a hard time controlling your sugar levels talk to the doctor ASAP cause they will be able to start you on meds or adjust them accordingly. If they do so happen to have to induce you or give you a c-section, it'll be what's best and what's safest for you and baby, so just research what might happen and try not to worry about it until that time comes. No use in worrying about something that hasn't even happened yet. That's not good for you or baby. :)",

            "answer": "Sounds like you need to hurry your doctor up! I see a perinatologist as well as the OB, that's usually the specialist you will see for GD. They will be the ones to prescribe you insulin pills or shots depending on how bad you have it. Besides staying away from sugary things also stay away from a lot of carbs, cause carbs turn into glucose (sugar). You still need to eat some carbs just don't eat a lot. You also have to watch natural sugars like fruit and juices. Unfortunately it blows but when you get a hold of controlling it, it gets easier I promise.",

Finally got some information, but I'm still in the dark (hopefully until tomorrow). I just started the glucometer reading last week and my fasting readings were a little high (only been 4 days and only two days were high) so they were quick to shove pills down my throat. What determines when an alternative course of treatment should be utilized? Shouldn't there be a time frame on the first course of action or am I being ignorant to the importance of lowering my sugar? These are a couple of questions I'm going to ask because I'm constantly being told that the pills pose the risk of hypoglycemia. It's scary. Sorry, for some reason, this is a touchy subject for me.

They are having me come in 2 times a week now. Once for them to monitor the stress level of baby and to check to see if their is protein in my urine to make sure I am not starting Preeclampsia.(apparently if you have GD you are more at risk for preeclampsia) They also send you to get the ultra sound to measure the baby's growth (To make sure it isn't to big). If I go into preterm labor which is common with GD they will give steroids to help develop the baby's lungs to they are mature and they can do a c-section. I am in the same exact boat as you! This just happened to me today. My ultra sound will be on Monday and my next doc appointment will be on Tuesday. How far along are you?",
