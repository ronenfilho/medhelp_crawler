            "answer": "I totally agree with you, 100%! I dislike those posts and Ignore 'em and keep my rude comments to myself. Like people tryin' to Induce themselves with castor oil and what not, like really!!! Baby Is ready when he/she Is ready!!! I'm bein' Induced due to a complication a week before my due date (preeclampsia), and I'm mad about It! Yes, It's better for him to be Induced for his safety, as well as mine, then wait It out and have complications arise and possibly have a life threatening situation for the both of us, but I feel like I'm failing as a mother that I can't have my baby boy be fully cooked and be completely full term and come out when he wants to. But some people don't see It that way, they're tired of bein' pregnant and will try anythin' to get their baby out sooner than later. You know what comes with pregnancy, It's not all joy and happiness! Juss deal with It! Rant over, lol.",
