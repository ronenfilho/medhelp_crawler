            "answer": "if you really want an epidural, but are aonly worried about the needle, then i can tell you, go ahead and get the epidural. i don't know about any one else, but that one or two seconds of the needle was nothing compared to the contractions. i think at the time, you will most likely be so focused on the pain of the contractions that the epidural will be a piece of cake. personally for me, i loved the epidural. it made the birthing process much less traumatic for me and didn't cloud my judgment as painkillers would. my only advice is to wait as long as you can to get the epidural. i got it at 7 cm and that worked great for me.good luck.",

            "answer": "I went natural with both my kids. They were big too .... 9.6 and 9.7. My best advice is do your research and see what fits you best. If it's the needle that scares you the most .... trust me, you'll be begging for that neddle when you're in the thick of labor. Because a needle is nothing compared to the pain of labor.My personal reasons for going natural were the statistics and questionable side effects the narcotic has on the baby. Now this is a touchy subject and many I'm sure will disagree. But based on my trusted medical team, it was confirmed the meds do pass onto the baby. They are not \"supposed\" to be harmful, but do cause for a drousier baby. And since statics show breastfeeding (which was VERY important to me) a baby w/o having had an epidural is more successful. Again .... just my opinion ... don't everyone jump all over me. I'm sure MANY many many people have had drugs and breastfed very successfully. Plus it had been said having any kind of intervention while in the labor process increases your chance of having a C-section, which I wanted to avoid as much as I could. Labor generally is faster without meds as well and recovery easier.Again ... this is my PERSONAL opinion. I wanted to experience the labor process and have the best odds for a successful birthing experience. I do have a high tolerance for pain, and I am a very strong willed person. Without those two ingredients, I don't think I could have done it. It requires a lot of strength, endurance, will, and confidence. You have to know YOU CAN DO IT. Have faith in your goal and stick with it. I had a healthy pregnancy and a routine labor. Some people don't fit that mold and therefore it might not be in their best interest to go natural. You have to weight your condition and find out what works best for your personal situation. This is just my account.I wouldn't change a thing about it. It was very hard and I am very proud that I did it. I dont' consider those who opt for medication weak, I just know what works best for me. I tend to be a purest when it comes to labor and babies. I breastfed my DS until 10 months and I hope to go even longer with my DD who is 3 months now. I make homemade baby food and try and use all organic food. So having a natural labor is just part of what I believe in for myself.Good luck in your decision making process and the end of your pregnancy.",

Any decision based on fear is apt to be a bad decision.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know any women that have had natural childbirth with whom you could talk?\u00a0\u00a0Not alarmists or dramaqueens either.I had an epidural with baby1 and almost ended up with C-section (or worse) due to the way it depressed his heart and delayed the contractions. 20 hrs, 3 of them pushing since epidurals make it so hard to push, plus 18,000 labor&delivery bill. I am the biggest wimp with the lowest pain threshold on the planet (can barely brush my own hair) BUT for baby2 I had to try naturally. I couldn't put her through the risk. And guess what? It was okay, do-able, the pain ends and you have a healthy baby. With baby3, I was more nervous, don't know why, maybe cause I'm much older now. Still, I kept telling myself it was leading somewhere, it would be over and tomorrow I'd look back and have a baby in my arms. The cm's flew by, I stayed in hospital jacuzzi (almost named the baby jacuzzi), did my breathing---yes indeed it hurt--only thought I was going to die once (yes, from the pain) but had good people around me I trusted who told me no, I wasn't actually going to (my husband, my doctor). Whaddaya know? It was true. Pushing is downright fun when you're not on epidural and all uncoordinated.I'm proud of all 3 events in which I did the best I knew how. But after baby1 and the epi sideeffects, I knew that I could give baby better than that, even me.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, baby1 was 20 hours, baby2 was 45 minutes, baby 3 was about 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0The Bradley method (get the book online or better yet a class!) is awesome--you can actually relax and be on top of contractions not a floundering thrashing bucket of fear the women describe above. That makes me cringe and I promise you that doesnt have to happen.\u00a0\u00a0(PS My sister had a 11lb baby at home with no drugs, just a midwife.",
