I had severe severe preeclampsia with my first and Im high risk for developing it again with my second. Im ten weeks now. My doc said if i start getting high blood pressure again they will start me on magnesium pills. And if that don't work then hospitalization with a magnesium drip. Do you have high blood pressure now? If so they should start you on the magnesium pills.",
