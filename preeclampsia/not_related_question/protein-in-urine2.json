High protein in urine can be extremely dangerous for me and baby. Causing seizures or other heart problems. My protein is border line which means they caught it early. A sign of it is high BP which is how they knew to test my urine.",

    "question": "My protein level was at an 827. Just left the hospital from over night. My BP and baby is fine which is why they felt comfortable enough to let me leave. I have an appointment with my Dr on Monday to see what needs to be done next. I'm only 32 weeks so we're hoping to keep baby in as long as possible. C Section will not be discussed unless we feel like baby girl is in danger. They have been giving me the steroid shots to help her lungs develope just in case she does need to be taken out. Prayers please, ladies!!",
