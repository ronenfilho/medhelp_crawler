            "answer": "I think unless you have preeclampsia the hospitals won't let you have the baby any earlier than 39 weeks. The March of Dimes has pushed to regulate this because too many Drs are taking babies too early. The long lager the baby stays in utero the better off the baby is. Don't rush it unless its medically necessary!",

Unless you are at risk or your baby is at risk they won't induce you till after your due date there is still huge differences between babies born on or after their due date and babies born even just a week early.

My Dr already knows that I am having a second c-section and I'm really going to try to push for a c-section at 37+3 at my next appt. I know they will let you get one at 38 weeks so what is four days sooner.. wish me luck haha",
