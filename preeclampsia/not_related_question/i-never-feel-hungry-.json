            "answer": "My first prenatal visit I weighed close to 147 pounds and it was my heaviest wait aside from when I gave birth. I had an appt every week during my first trimester because I was having really heavy bleeding. I had hyperemesis and was very sick throughout my pregnancy and by 20 weeks, I weighed 130 pounds. I didn't begin to gain anything until 28 weeks when I started swelling. Doctor's and midwives actually advise against big weight gains in the first trimester. At your next appointment I would just bring it up. But with my height, I was considered average weight when I got pregnant and my midwife was totally unconcerned with my low weight gain. I ended up weighing 156lbs when I checked into L&D to give birth. When I left, I weighed 135, and once my blood pressure got stabilized again (had preeclampsia) I weighed 125, which is my current weight. Good luck, and I hope this helps!",
