            "answer": "Your hormones and feelings can affect the baby... but its mostly the stress that affects them... it can cause preterm labor and you to either stop eating or binge... neither or which are healthy. I have a friend whose husband died when she was 4-5 months pregnant and she cried and was depressed the last few months, which is understandable... her daughter was born healthy and looks just like daddy... you just want to keep stress levels low because it can cause other problems (high blood pressure which leads to preeclampsia)",

            "answer": "I think it's relative. It's better to cry and get it out than retain the stress or anxiety of the situation that has you upset.It's not really good in any way for you or the baby if you're generally depressed, but seeing as this is apparently a situation in itself, I'd say it won't bother the baby.My first child's father broke up with me when I was four months pregnant and I was later diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder that had been triggered by him leaving. I had hallucinations, anxiety, disorientation, etc but my daughter is fine. She was awful fussy at times but nothing that cuddling didn't put a stop to. She was generally pretty easy to care for.",
