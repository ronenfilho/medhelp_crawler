None of it was that bad.. I would do it again without thinking twice about it.Best of luck.. N don't worry too much about it.. It isn't a big deal.",

I felt pretty wired after my shot and I am feeling that again. I am hoping to at least get some sleep tonight.The shot itself wasn't too bad. Had it in my backside and it just burned for a minute and was okay after that. I had one yesterday and today.It's not too bad at all and I HATE shots.",

He's been watching me every 2 weeks all along, checking the placenta, growth and fluid levels at every visit. He was planning on doing steroids all along prophylactically, since it's something he can do in case there's any problems. Turns out it was a pretty good plan, since steroids are a treatment for optic neuritis, my newest ailment. He said they could have given me steroids sooner for the eye problem, but the opthamologist was hesitant and decided to wait until i would've gotten them anyways.It may be just paranoia, I've had a feeling all along that something will eventually go wrong though. I am worried that there's some underlying condition that causes my issues. We're going to follow up more after I have the baby.",

I barely got ANY sleep last night.Don't know if it's related to the shot, or the fact that yesterday was the first hot day of the summer, but i retained a LOT of fluid yesterday. I weighed myself in the AM and PM, and I gained 5-6 pounds in 12 hours. I lost the weight by this morning.The shot itself hurt like crazy for the first 1/2 hour, but then was fine.I'm pretty sure it's already helping with the optic neuritis though, so I am actually looking forward to my second shot today.",
