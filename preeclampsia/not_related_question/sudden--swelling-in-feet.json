            "answer": "When I come home from work my feet ache but are not a swollen, it is important to elevate your feet, this brings blood back to the rest of your body from being on them for hours. Also helps with preventing varicose veins. I lay on my back and put my legs against the wall, I try for a 90\u00a4 angle, you can literally feel the blood going back to the rest of your body. Very relieving :) hope this helps!",
