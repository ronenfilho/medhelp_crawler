            "answer": "Also, I'd call your doctor, or their after hours (24 hours) number if they have one to let them know of your symptoms, headaches are usually a concern to doctors, along with dizziness because they want to make sure they aren't missing preeclampsia (not saying you have it, or that it sounds like you do) but just giving them a heads up, especially if the symptoms have lasted a while, or don't seem to get any better with tylenol, rest, or increased fluids, I'd let them know just in case they want to check you at Labor and Delivery. It's possible the heat could be getting to you, or dehydrating you without you being aware. Hopefully and more than likely, it's just a bad headache though! Goodluck and congrats on the baby! :)",
