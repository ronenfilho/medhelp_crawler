    "question": "So yesterday I was laying in bed and got areal bad headache. I laid in bed basically all day. I took a nap but when I woke up I was super nausiated, then I got hot, and started having super bad back pain. I took a bath and tylenol and went back to sleep. I'm 29+5 weeks. Today I woke up still in pain and still nausiated. My husband works 3 hours away and I have no one to watch our 2 year old. My husband will come home if I needed him to. I'm just uncomfortable. Any suggestions?",
