            "answer": "Sorry, but sonograms can be off by up to 3 lbs. blueeyedtabbycat just delivered a little 7 lb baby when she was told her daughter would be well over 9 lbs.Also, 34 weeks is WAY TOO EARLY to induce. No doctor would ever do that. Despite how big they think baby may be, their lungs still need to develop or you're going to have a baby in the NICU, with possible long-term problems (asthma, for example).",

Hopefully yopu will go sometime around 37 weeks (full term) and have a nice healthy baby! I think your doctor might concider sweeping your membranes after you hit the 37 week mark so that you dont go too late. Anyways, Vent away:)",
