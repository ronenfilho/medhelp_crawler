            "answer": "Most of the reasons are problematic. low fluid, lack of growth, preeclampsia...might not be too serious but its due to something that isn't something you would want. Also being past your due date. Doctors are different, but most wont induce simply because youre miserable. Some may within a week of the due date for an important family issue...such as your husband being deployed. It is unethical to induce before 39 weeks if not for medical purposes.",
