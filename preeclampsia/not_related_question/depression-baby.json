            "answer": "I'd be more worried about health issues like blood pressure/preeclampsia if your depression involves high stress. It's not going to HURT baby normally just to be depressed, but getting to tense/high blood pressure COULD cause like preterm labor. I've seen women who lost their partners during pregnancy and the baby was ok. :) Don't worry too much or let it make your depression worse.",
