If your husband is going to be home at 36 weeks, then there's a good chance you'll make it hun, your doctor won't let you go any earlier, they'll stop it unless you develop any problems that can be life threatening, like preeclampsia, etc. I went into labor at 34+6, and they stopped it, so I wouldn't worry about it!",

Most women will go 37+ weeks though, so unless you're doing something you shouldn't (smoking, drinking, drugs) or have a family history of preterm labour it shouldn't be an issue.",
