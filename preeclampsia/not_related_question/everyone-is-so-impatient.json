I made a post today- so if it is directed towards me or not is another thing. I'm 40w2d with a scheduled c section for next Tuesday due to a cervix \"problem.\" I made a post today because I've tried everything to get my cervix in position and ready so that I wouldn't have to go through it.I'm definitely NOT going to miss the frustration waking up everyday knowing I'm one day closer to something I am 100% scared about and that the things I've tried weren't making any progress.",

With having to wait for almost nothing nowadays (even three minutes in a drive thru pisses some people off haha) waiting an entire pregnancy must be an eternity for some people. I too am seeing people being induced for no other medical reason than impatience lol. Just wait till it's the baby that's the impatient one and they realize this WAS the easy part!",

I'm on my 4th and last pregnancy and yes I want it over because im anxious to meet my child, but literally from day one of finding out I was pregnant I've had nearly everything go wrong (so far no pre eclampsia thank God) but I'm in constant pelvic and pelvic girdle pain that doesn't allow me to walk for very long. I've had kidney stones 4 times (once requiring surgery) I have gestational diabetes, and plecenta previa. I've had severe RLS that interrupts my sleep due mostly in part to being anemic and for the majority of the first trimester I was unable to have a bowel moment naturally (going 3 weeks without one at all) I'm DONE with being pregnant and I'm ready for the next chapter.",

I am weirded out by the movements and I feel like it's alien invasion. Don't get me wrong I am excited to be a mother but I think if I want more children in the future, I may adopt. I just don't like being pregnant. I hate the attention. I hate how everyone treats me like I am breakable. I feel weak and less than 100% which makes it tough for me. I guess the only part I have liked is seeing my daughter on the ultrasound. I haven't met her but I already love her to pieces!",

I walked because I had to walk the dog and the mailbox was a few blocks away... I had sex just to have sex-- not to induce... Ifigured she would come when she wanted rto although I was very uncomfortable. ... this time around I fear that they are going to have to induce me or give me a c section-- neither of what I want...but im high risk for preeclampsia and I already have gestational diabetes.... this is my last pregnancy so I was hoping I would really enjoy it.. but im not...

For some, they can sit back and say \"pregnancy is wonderful, just enjoy it\". But for others like myself, they are just struggling with pain and sickness just hoping to get to the next day. It's hard to enjoy the constant urge to vomit for 9 months straight and the severe pain that keeps many from being able to sleep or even sit comfortably. Hang in there ladies, and if you don't enjoy being pregnant, that's completely understandable! I'm sure you will love your baby all the more for what you endured.",
