            "answer": "I went into preterm labour with my first. I had severe preeclamplsia and got a stomach bug which brought on contractions at 34wks. They hooked me up and said it was the real deal. My ob said my body had had enough so they were just going to let it happen. Got the steroid shot and called everyone. But then 12hrs later the contractions stopped and they sent me home. A week later the preeclamplsia got worse and I had a csection. I never had any reactions to the steroid shots tho and they never told me of any possible side effects. I hope everything goes well for you!",

I didn't know.\u00a0\u00a025 weeks it got so bad I couldn't sleep. I went to pee and saw I was covered in blood. Mom took me to the er. I was 100% thinned out and 4cms.I started pumping me full of drugs. I had two ivs in each arm. I had to get the lung shots as well. I received an ultrasound each day.\u00a0\u00a0I was on strict beef rest. On day 4 my water broke. There was no stopping it after that. I gave birth to a 2lb baby. We stayed in the nicu for 3 months.They don't know why it happened. I was over weight. Other then that I was healthy.",

    "question": "just wondering how many mommas out their have experianced pre term labor?\u00a0\u00a0what happen? any idea of what caused it? how was it treated at the hospital?\u00a0\u00a0did the labor stop on its own?I know lots of q's though this is just what Im dealing with right now. im having baby #4. I whent into labor yesterday and was in labor for a number of hrs, I have dilated a bit. I whent to the hospital and after several hrs it stoped all on its own. the hospital kept me for several more hrs and gave me a steroid shot in my hip to help my baby's lungs to be stronger,\u00a0\u00a0incase she ends up being born early.\u00a0\u00a0frustrating though, they warned me that my blood sugars will go up. wow did I not expect by how much. I now have to take 40 units of insulin with each meal. they have kept me and monitored me all day today and at midnight tonight they will be giving me another steroid shot in my hip. I have to wonder if this will send my sugars up even more. they said that this will be my new change for a few weeks. then what? ok, just have to remind myself 6 more weeks until show time, when I get induced.\u00a0\u00a0sigh.",
