            "answer": "Yeah Tylenol is about it, make sure you are staying hydrated (water or Gatorade helps with that), also it could be lack of caffeine if you're used to drinking that on a regular basis, but the reason they watch for headaches is because it could be a sign of preeclampsia (pregnancy induced high blood pressure). So tell your doc.",
