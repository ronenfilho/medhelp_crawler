My boy was 18 inches long 4lbs 12ozs\u00a0\u00a0He was born at 35 weeks I also had 2 miscarriages before him. So far this pregnancy seems to be going great.My mom delivered on time with me late with my brother had no complications but her labor lasted forever.My aunt Tracy had preeclampsia with her first but still carried him to term. She had to have a csection with her second and her 3rd she delivered but they had to use forceps.My aunt Theresa was pregnant with twins had them at 28 weeks. And had a complicated pregnancy.I believe all women are different and have different deliveries and all pregnancies are different.",
