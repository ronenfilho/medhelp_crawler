            "answer": "I know their lungs are fully developed by 34 weeks. If they are telling you to stay on bed rest take their advice. Make sure to drink ALOT of water and eat really good. Eat a protein\u00a0\u00a0and iron rich diet, chicken, lean beef, peanut butter, etc. along with veggies, spinach is really good for you.My friend had preterm labor they were abel to stop it but she still had the baby about a month early. The baby was in the NICU for 2 weeks.If you take really good care of yourself you may be able to prolong it.Did they give you any of this info as far as diet and fluids?",

            "answer": "24 weeks is considered viable, some have come earlier, but the longer they are in there the better the chances are. 30 weeks would give the baby a better then 95 %chance, where 25 weeks, I think are like 50%",

It's all about lung development. If they see you will have to deliver early they will bed rest you and usually give you steroid shots to increase lung development rather quickly. Good luck",

            "answer": "I just wanted to share my story and some hope.\u00a0\u00a0During my second pregnancy, I was considered high risk due to my first son being born at 33 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had ultrasounds every two weeks, and shots were administered shots to prevent pre-term labor.\u00a0\u00a0During the start of the second trimester, I was informed that I had placenta previa, but that the placenta would likely be pulled up as the baby grew, and present no problem. So, we are watching for all of these things, and at 27 weeks exactly, the placenta abrupted, and my son was born by emergency C-section, weighing 2 lbs., 5 oz. and just 14 inches long.\u00a0\u00a0He was in the NICU for 12 weeks, and went through all of the typical preemie scenarios: intubation, feedings by tube, brain scans, needles in 2-3 places at any given time, incubator, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily, I was given the steroid shots while in the hospital the days just before he was born.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that the shots made all the difference for him.\u00a0\u00a0We were lucky that there was no bleeding in his brain, and that although he started out with mild retinopathy of prematurity, this has since resolved.\u00a0\u00a0He had a bout of pneumonia and\u00a0\u00a0jaundice, and had to endure a spinal tap, and again, daily manipulation and blood draws.\u00a0\u00a0However, he is now 9 1/2 months old, weighs over 17 lbs., and is very healthy and active.\u00a0\u00a0He is functioning at the level of a six month old, which is right where he should be.\u00a0\u00a0Miracles are performed by NICU doctors and staff everyday...and although I hope your baby is born many weeks from now...there is certainly hope that he or she will be just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!",

            "answer": "I had my son at 28wks 5 days gestation, it is a tough road but the good side is they can help the little ones so much. He is a happy healthy 3 nearly 4 year old, he does not look different other than a few scars on his chest from where they had to inflate his lungs. Their lungs are\u00a0\u00a0not great when they are born that early and we didn't get to hold him until he was 2 weeks old that was so hard. Any way I hope you will go full term or close to it but at least you have warning of this and you will be able to receive the steroids early enough for his/her lungs etc to give a better helping hand, I had no warning what so ever. Scary stuff when you don't know whats happening but the doctors explain everything and so do the nurses and ask them to speak english if you don't understand something sometimes they forget who they are speaking with just some advice just in case... GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!",

This is a very scary situation. As much as I am ready to be an aunt I pray that she can go at least a couple weeks longer without putting my sister in law in danger of course. Its encouraging to see what the others have written. But I praised God that she was conceived and I will praise God when she is born. We must now rely on our Great Physician and put our faith and trust in Him.",
