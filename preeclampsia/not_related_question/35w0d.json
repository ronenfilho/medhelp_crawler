Doing a 24 hour urine collection to see how much protein I pass and based on that we'll see if it's time to induce.

Most of it is from water retention. I can barely tell that I have feet because of how swollen they are. I even look like I've had a facelift because my forhead is swollen. I'm just done with this. I'll be so excited to get this over with and have my body back to myself again. On the bright side, the prenatal vitamins have given me kick *** nails, I've never had long nails until I got pregnant. And my hair actually has volume instead of just being flat flat flat. So\u00a0\u00a0at least my upper body looks good! Haha",
