            "answer": "I had them worse in my latter pregnancies too, also early on. They were really scary!!! I was so afraid I was going to have a heart attack! Some of it was anxiety, too. Anxiety then makes it worse, which also made my blood pressure go up. I never had a work up over it though.",

As i was driving, i started to feel my chest tighten and my pulse was so high at a red light, i had trouble keeping count- i think it was around 130. i suspect part of the problem was that i took a nice hot shower (which can raise the pulse) and went out in to the 10 degree weather. I also had my usual morning vomitting which probably pushed my pulse up too.so, with the baby at the sitter and the house to myself, you'd think i'd get some rest. probably not- i just called DH to let him know i made it home OK and he informed me that he has been vomitting and having diarrea all morning and may be coming home. i pray i don't get that, because that will surely put me in the hospital. argh.",

            "answer": "for me, 95 is normal, especially during pregnancy.i have had mild tachycardia for years- maybe even all my life, who knows? i first noticed over 10 years ago, which was when i had my first cardio work-up. all came back completely normal.all came back normal during my last pregnancy as well- the halter showed a consistent high heart rate, but they decided that's just normal for me since i've had it for years and they cannot find anything wrong. during my last pregnancy the cardiologist sent me for a full renal workup since i do have a tendancy to get dehydrated. he thought that perhaps the way my kidneys were processing was leading to dehydration and consequently the tachycardia. all tests showed my my kidneys functioning well.good news is after sitting on the couch for an hour, i am feeling much better and my pulse is down. guess i'll have to take it easy this weekend til i see the dr on Monday. i'll just have to figure out how to convince my toddler to let mommy drool on herself all weekend :P\u00a0\u00a0actually, she's gotten very good at it. She mimicks my coughs and sneezes and brings me tissues. poor thing has even learned how to mimic my wretching noises when i puke. Thank goodness she has learned to play on her own very nicely. the house is babyproofed well enough that i can even dose off while she plays.",

            "answer": "So, I went to the cardiologist today, but did not get any answers. Apparently the doctor is quite befuddled because my symptoms do not fit any profile. My blood pressure has been consistantly low, and in general, when a pregnant person is tachycardic, they have blood pressure problems as well. He was equally befuddled last time, and I can tell it really bothers him.I asked about limiting activities- he said he can't make any recommendations either for or against. very helpful. I am wearing a halter which will hopefully help determine at what point i am physically bothered by my symptoms and to look for correlations between events and level of discomfort.he is wondering if perhaps there's a problem with return of blood flow, and suggested that when i have an episode, i see if it corrects itself by elevating my legs. He was also wondering if it is related in some way to having preeclampsia last time, but i doubt it based on what my OB says about preeclampsia. I see my OB tonight- maybe he'll have some more helpful suggestions.",

    "question": "Hi! I asked this last week on the pregnancy forum, but got few responses. It's gotten worse, so i thought i'd ask here.I know that both tachycardia and palpatations can be normal during pregnancy. i experienced them with my last pregnancy and had a full cardio work-up. everything looked good. but last time, i had those problems much later on in pregnancy. this time, it's starting much earlier and it's worse. i almost went to the ER last night when after laying in bed for an hour, my pulse was still 120. It seems my pulse is generally 100 resting these days. I called my doctor (first time i ever called after hours) and he said that i would be fine and to stay home, but that he wanted to get me in to a cardiologist in the next few days.for those of you who experienced these symptoms, were they this bad this early? was it worse in second pregnancy than the first? i'm staying home today, and if i don't get in to a dr i'll stay home tomorrow too. i do have a cold too :(",
