I was also told that I had too many factors working against me getting pregnant naturally or via a fertility clinic like weight, age (31 at the time), blocked fallopian tube and hormones. Well long story short, God blessed me with a natural good ole fashiin surprise pregnancy in which I delivered a healthy and beautiful baby girl July 2013 and now I'm natyrally pregnant (17.5 weeks) again but this time with a healthy little boy. Whatever you do, just follow your doctors orders, keep up with appointments and stay positive through it all...you'll ve enjoying your bundle of joy soon, so, no need to worry...there are lots of us that share the pcos journey and we've crossed the finish line with the cutest little trophies and you will too.Congratulations on baby and best wishes throughout and beyond your pregnancy....enjoy...you're a mommy :-) :-) :-) !!!",
