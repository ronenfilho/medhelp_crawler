    "question": "I had my 36 week appointment last Friday, weighed in at 200 exactly. I had my 37 week appointment this Wednesday and weighed in at 206! Doctor also said she saw a little protein in my urine. No pain or vomitting or contractions. I haven't had as big of an appetite so I don't know how I gained so much weight! My whole body is swollen, could that be why?I woke up today not feeling right and haven't felt my daughter move as much as normal. And the few times I did feel her, they were gentle light movements, not her normal Hard hits.",
