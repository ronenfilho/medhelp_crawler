            "answer": "Weather you are pregnant or not stress is always bad for you, but yes stress is just as bad while pregnant.. It could cause problems for you and baby. I was the same way when i was pregnant, it literally felt like i cried everyday!! And i truely believe due to my stress it caused me to have preeclampsia, and i was induced two weeks early due to it. My blood pressure was so high it could have caused alot of bad things for me and my baby boy, and i would never forgave myself. There will always be a bit of stress being pregnant, but thing of LO and all the great things he/she will bring you. And always leave it in Gods hands to handle the hard times.",

            "answer": "It is bad for you regardless. However I've read that studies show that when we stress there's a chemical released in our bodies. When we're pregnant that chemical spike is also passed to the baby, hence why they say whatever we are feeling the baby is feeling. Different emotions cause different chemical reactions in our bodies and the babies get them all too.After birth it can effect the baby if they have felt a lot of stress in utero.Idk how true all the articles are, but being a bio and chem student I would believe its pretty on point and makes sense.Best thing I could tell u is saying eff the world and do what's right for your baby. I've had to lose contact with my parents and family from all the stress and abuse I was going through. Its hard but I feel better, so I know my baby does and as mothers that's all we can do.I'm sorry for whatever is stressing you out but know that you can always talk here if you need someone (:",

I know it isn't healthy, I try to make myself feel better but somehow Its another thing that makes me stressed or upset. Is it really that bad for my baby? :( I feel guilty. I must admit the hormones don't help and I feel like I'm 50000 times more emotional. FTM here.",
