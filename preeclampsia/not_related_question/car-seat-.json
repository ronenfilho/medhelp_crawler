It made things so much easier, rather than waiting until the last minute to buy everything we needed and spending countless amounts at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0We also registered at Babiesrus and were able to buy from our registry in order to accumulate rewards points. You get 10% back from your total registry purchase 10 weeks after your baby's due date. If you play your cards right and get coupons you can save alot!! We will end up with a $200 gift card just for that :) good luck! !",

Then a few weeks later found out I'm having a baby girl and went bananas in the girl's section lol. Though Babies R Us does have the 10% back on things purchased from your registry, Walmart is so much more cheaper. I'm 38 weeks and bought diapers today from Babies R Us, the store brand, and it was $9.99 for 50 count of newborn. At Walmart the store brand was $5.98 for 44 count for newborn. But wipes at Babies R Us today were buy 2 72 count for $5",
