            "answer": "I am so sorry to hear that you lost your baby. I too had a stillborn at 36 weeks. I had an appointment the day before and they found protien in my urine but told me it was fine, that the baby was big and all was well. the next day I felt a pop and it felt like my water had broken but when i looked down there was blood everywhere.They told me that the placenta was bad and the baby had not been feeding properly, He was the size of a 5 month fetus. So much for them saying he was a big baby the day before.I know it doesnt help, but I feel it truely is just natures way, If they had somehow saved him, He may have had a lot of disabilities.I had previously had 2 very healthy babies and have since had 2 more very healthy babies.My heart goes out to you,",

            "answer": "I to had a still born at 7 months. I was in a car accident and someone hit me from the side. I went to the ER were they told me everything was OK. Yeah right, went to another hospital about 3 days later where they said my son had died. There are many reasons why a stillborn can occur. I can say that for those 4 days, I know I fealt him kick but after all test were run the doctor said that what I was prolly feeling was phantom kicking and moving. I was heartbroken, and I am so sorry to hear about your loss. As far as the causes, here are some. I actually and in the middle of writing a paper, since I am entering Medical School, and the topic was about stillborn. This is what some of the reasons of stillborn:Birth defects: About 15 to 20 percent of stillborn babies have one or more birth defects. At least, 20 percent of these have chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome.Others have other birth defects resulting from genetic, environmental or unknown causes.Placental problems: Placental problems cause about 25 percent of stillbirths . One of the most common placental problems is placental abruption. In this condition, the placenta peels away, partly to almost completely, from the uterine wall before delivery. It results in heavy bleeding that can threaten the life of mother and baby. Sometimes it can cause the fetus to die from lack of oxygen. Women who smoke cigarettes or use cocaine during pregnancy are at increased risk of placental abruption.Poor fetal growth: Fetuses who are growing too slowly are at increased risk of stillbirth. About 40 percent of stillborn babies have poor growth. Women who smoke cigarettes or have high blood pressure are at increased risk of having a baby that grows too slowly. An ultrasound examination during pregnancy can show that the fetus is growing poorly, allowing health care providers to carefully monitor the pregnancy.Infections: Infections involving the mother, fetus or placenta appear to cause about 10 to 25 percent of stillbirths. Infections are an important cause of fetal deaths before 28 weeks of pregnancy .Some infections may cause no symptoms in the pregnant woman. These include genital and urinary tract infections and certain viruses, such as fifth disease (parvovirus infection). These infections may go undiagnosed until they cause serious complications, such as fetal death or preterm birth (before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy).Chronic health conditions in the pregnant woman: About 10 percent of stillbirths are related to chronic health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease and thrombophilias (blood clotting disorders). These conditions may contribute to poor fetal growth or placental abruption. Pregnancy-induced forms of high blood pressure (such as preeclampsia) also may increase the risk, especially when they recur in a second or later pregnancy.Umbilical cord accidents: Accidents involving the umbilical cord may contribute to about 2 to 4 percent of stillbirths. These include a knot in the cord or abnormal placement of the cord into the placenta. These can deprive the fetus of oxygen.Other causes of stillbirth include trauma (such as car accidents), postdate pregnancy (a pregnancy that lasts longer than 42 weeks), Rh disease (an incompatibility between the blood of mother and baby), and lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during a difficult delivery. These causes are uncommon.Hope this information helps a little bit, I know it is hard to get over the fact that you were so close. My thoughts and prayers go out to you and your family.",
