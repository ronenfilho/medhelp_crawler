            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I had this SO bad when I was pregnant with my 5 month old. I dont want to scare you but, I had it bad.\u00a0\u00a0And boy it was the absolute worse part of my pregnancy. I can take everything else.\u00a0\u00a0Heck, I'll even do labor again (with the epidural of course) then have that carpal tunnel again.\u00a0\u00a0That is how horrible it was.\u00a0\u00a0I would wake up in the middle of the night in absolute agony and crying because my hands had gotten so numb that it ached. I slept with a wrist guard on both hands in order to keep them straight so that the blood would flow properly.\u00a0\u00a0Didnt help much.\u00a0\u00a0I got it in the late stages of my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing that they can do for you.\u00a0\u00a0It's something in your wrist that swells and causes less blood to flow through. Its hard enough trying to sleep when your huge but, it's even worse trying to sleep with your hands propped up on pillows while sleeping on your right side. My poor BF.\u00a0\u00a0I couldnt even hold my friends baby because I would go numb and I was afraid to drop her.I would wake up in the middle of the night to put my hand under cold water so that the swelling inside would reduce. It helped a little but only temporarily.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry that I'm not much help but, there isnt anything the dr can do. You just have to deal with it until your baby is here. So sorry.",
