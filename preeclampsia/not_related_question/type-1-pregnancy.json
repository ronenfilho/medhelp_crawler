            "answer": "First relax. Being pregnant will be a very special time of your life. Cutting sugar and eating healthy is the most important. If you have any infection in your body it will make your A1C go up and down. You need a antibiotic to get rid of your sinus infection and your sugar will calm down. The baby will take what it needs just take care of yourself. Get on a low sodium diet and low carb diet but feed you and the baby sensibly.",

            "answer": "Congratulations!\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Type 1 when I was 4, have been on an insulin pump since I was 16, & gave birth to a perfectly healthy girl at the age of 25.\u00a0\u00a0It can be done, but it takes a lot of hard work on your part along with a great medical team.\u00a0\u00a0I worked with my normal OBGYN who referred me to see a Maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist & Dietitian.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to explain my medical care during my pregnancy is that my OB took care of me & my MFMS was responsible for making sure I was taking care of my baby.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0checked my bloodsugar at least 10 times a day!\u00a0\u00a0I checked it when I woke up, before every meal, 2 hours after every meal, at bedtime, at 3am & any time I felt the need to!\u00a0\u00a0I had to keep a log book of every morsel of food that I ate or drank along with my bloodsugars.\u00a0\u00a0I provided those to my MFMS weekly & she helped me to identify foods that would cause bloodsugar spikes & I tried to stay away from them. (I went 6 months without Chinese food!!!)\u00a0\u00a0I actually lost weight during my pregnancy because I was so healthy & ended up only gaining 11 pounds during my pregnancy & had an 8 pound baby!\u00a0\u00a0Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy, but it is SO worth it.\u00a0\u00a0In the end, I started to have some low bloodsugars which was highly unusual & my MFMS said it was because my placenta was aging.\u00a0\u00a0I had an amniocentesis to ensure my daughters lungs were mature & she was born at 37 weeks 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0All of the hard work during my pregnancy paid off!\u00a0\u00a0She was 8 pounds even, 21 inches long, & never spent a moment in the NICU.\u00a0\u00a0You CAN do this!\u00a0\u00a0I'll be praying for you!",

            "answer": "Research has shown that having an A1c above 7.5% at the time of conception and in the early phases of pregnancy puts your child at an increased risk of developmental defects, so you will need to be monitored very closely.During the 2nd and 3rd trimster, it is optimal to aim for an A1c near 6% in order to prevent excessive growth, which can lead to premature delivery, preeclampsia, and other complications during delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Working with a high-risk obstetrician will be in your best interest.There are many issues facing women with type-1 during pregnancy, but many have managed to overcome them and have successful pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0You might consider reading the book \"Balancing Pregnancy With Pre-Existing Diabetes\" by Cheryl Alkon, and visit the \"Diabetes Sisters\" website (https://diabetessisters.org/pregnancy) for some detailed articles on various aspects of the pregnancy.",
