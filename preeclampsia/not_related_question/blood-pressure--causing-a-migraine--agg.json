            "answer": "I know its easier said than done, but if you want to avoid complications you need to keep your stress level and blood pressure under control. It could lead to\u00a0\u00a0preeclampsia and that is not good for you or baby (I had it with my first and had to be induced). Have your hubby join you to your dr's appt and ask him to be as helpful as he can with your other child. Again I know thats hard, I'm a mother of 6 and am due here shortly but I'm trying to take it easy. Remember to ask for help whether it be to friends or family members. Good luck!! :)",
