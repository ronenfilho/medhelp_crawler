            "answer": "Ugh where should I begin.... I took my glucose test on Saturday, June 19th and passed it =0) On July 4th we had a lil scare because the baby wasn't moving so we ended up at the L&D, and as soon as they hooked me up he starting going crazy and kicked and moved all over, I really felt like an idiot since I didn't feel him move the whole day and when we got there he was moving, but the nurse said that she gets lots of expecting moms who's baby's do the same thing and that it's better to be safe than sorry =0) So then after that lil scare we went and pre-registered at the hospital on July 5th just in case something decides to come up, and boy am I happy that we did because at my 6th prenatal appt which was Tue. July 6th my blood pressure was 140/88 and it has been 120/70 throughout my whole entire pregnancy so now my Dr thinks that I am getting preeclampsia already which is super scary since I'm only 28 weeks and 4 days as of right now, so I had to be sent in on the 7th to go get my blood work done to see if I have preeclampsia and I wont know my results until Tue. July 13th which is my next Dr's appt, but I have a feeling deep down inside that I already have preeclampsia because my feet are super duper swollen and won't go down even with rest =0( I just really hope that I can make it to at least 37 weeks so my lil guy will be full term. But I do have some exciting news, tomorrow we're getting our 3D-4D ultrasound pics done so I'm super excited to see what my lil man looks like. Hope you ladies are having a better pregnancy than mine =0)",

            "answer": "I am definitely also slacking! Not in the not posting area but I about had a mental break down today with the issue of not getting anything done for this little girl... It makes me feel like I am totally unprepared and I am not this kind of person. As most of you know if you have read any of my journals that we are waiting to get major (well it has turned into all things baby) things baby until my hubby gets his re-enlistment bonus to get everything we need. We found out a few days ago that my hubs isn't going to get his bonus until about August 30th or so! I am FREAKING OUT! We do have a few back up plans (grandparents, parents, sisters) to help us out but I wanted everything perfect before she got here so when she does get here I can relax and rest and heal and spend time with all of us just as a nice little family. I guess we have to deal the hands we are dealt and maybe she will decide to stay in until her due date or at least until her mommy and daddy have everything ready for her =)",

            "answer": "Last two weeks we have been stressed about where were going to be moving. Last night Bf's sister asked if we wanted to move in with her. Last we heard her husband said absolutely not. Well we are moving in with them at the end of the month. (see other post for more details)I discussed how much pain I've been in with standing on my feet at the bar for 6 hour shifts and now that we are going to be moving somewhere where were only paying a couple hundred versus a thousand in rent I think it's time I quit the bar. Bf agreed that it was ok and we could make it on just his income now. I will still be working at the Hotel till mid August. I sit at that job and it's really not that bad.I went to the Dr today for my 32 week check up and everything looked perfect. He also agreed it was time for me to quit the bar. I left my appointment and went to the bar and told the owners tomorrow will be my last day. I am beyond over joyed at getting rid of that job.Last night I noticed some pain in my knuckles when I bend them. It's a little worse today and I forgot to mention it to my Dr. I think I will have to call tomorrow. It's in my fingers and toes. I think I might google it too.",

I found out that there are jacuzzi tubs in all the labor rooms and birthing balls available. I'm pretty excited about being able to use a tub. They wont let you deliver in the tub which I don't want to but I want to be able to labor in it to relax.I also found out they don't do walking epidurals so if I want one it's the full dose which I am not to keen on that idea.

I've also been really sick the past few days and am finally able to eat a little bit of something. It seems a bug is going around. I'm really excited because our stuff that my family got should be arriving this Sunday for us to pick up, so we're going to go through the room next to ours and start moving it all around and putting it into storage so we can set our room up this weekend. I've also been attempting to pack my hospital bag, but anything I think to put in I end up taking back out because I'm not sure if I'll need it between now and then, or if it's even needed to take. I just hate not knowing how long I'll be in the hospital for and I really don't want to overpack. I hope everyone else is doing good. :) we're all getting close to that finish line.",

It does make for some strange \"designs\" on my legs after sitting for a bit though LOLI pretty much have everything ready for the baby.\u00a0\u00a0With a couple of exceptions.\u00a0\u00a0I need to wipe down the plastic part of the carseat and put the cover back on.\u00a0\u00a0Then I can just snap it into the base in my truck and put a towel over it to keep dust/dirt off of it.\u00a0\u00a0I need to put the bassinet together.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the safety gate I ordered for my hallway gets here I will be putting together DS23mos toddler bed and moving him into his brothers room (he's still in the crib in ours right now).\u00a0\u00a0I've got mine and the babies hospital bags packed.\u00a0\u00a0I still need to pack the kids bags of stuff to keep them occupied since they will be going with us.\u00a0\u00a0I had DH pull the old double stroller out of the basement and I took it completely apart and washed it so I just need to put it back togheter.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that there's nothing baby related I NEED to do.On the other hand, I STILL need to paint the living room ceiling and walls and we need to put the baseboard down so that we can have the carpet installed in there soon.\u00a0\u00a0We just bought a brand new couch and recliner and I want to start using them but won't take the plastic off til the painting is done.\u00a0\u00a0I also need to rearrange the dining room becuase we just got 2 new dining tables.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, TWO! LOL\u00a0\u00a0It was cheaper to get 2 smaller ones and put them together rather than buying one large one that seats 8 which is what we need...we've outgrown our Kmart-6 seater LOL.My next ob is July 15th.\u00a0\u00a0I should get the papers from my doctor then to go preregister.\u00a0\u00a0I'll also do the epidural \"class\" at that point as well (basically signing the epidural consent forms ahead of time)Hopefully by next weeks update my \"to do\" list will be much smaller :)",
