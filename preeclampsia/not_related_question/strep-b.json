I was on them when I stayed in the hospital but that was 4 weeks ago so he didn't seem too concerned about not having enough time so I trust him. Lol",

    "question": "So ladies.. I am strep b positive and I'm 4cm and 100% effaced. My water isn't broke I'm being induced on Monday. How long do I need antibiotics in order for it to not be a harm to my baby?? I'm afraid I am going to go quickly because that's what everyone even my doctor says! I don't want him sick. I know they are starting an iv and antibiotics when I arrive and he's breaking my water when I get there but I didn't ask about the timing.",
