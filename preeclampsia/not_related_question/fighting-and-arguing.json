And his familu especially his mother has been horrible to me mu whole pregnancy. I know its not mu husbands fault so now I jist really try to make sure he feels appreciated and let him know he is a great husband and that I love him. He works hard to protect me from his families bad behavior and he works hard to provide for our family seeing I am on bed rest. At times I hate myself bc I feel like input him under stress and pressure but he always assures me he is happy. I guess its my hormones makig me nervous about nothing really. So instead of getting onto anyone especially my hubby I just have a little cry when I need it when im alone and have time yo myself to relax so I dont take any stress I have out on him or my 3 yr old or his family. Let me just say we havr had to totallu cut off his mother and familu except his dad bc they have been just so damn misable to br around. They actually make it unhealthy for me to be around or speak to them. I can't even answer their phone calls. My husband does all that. Well he did anyway. He doesn't anymore. Sorry for the long comment lol it turned into a vent",
