That was a C-section on steroids...they had a million more docs and nurses in there it seemed just in case something happened and I threw a clot and had a pulmonary embolism or worse. THAT was scary. I'm okay, obviously, but that experience taught me that even though normal delivery would have been \"ideal\", sometimes C-sections are the best thing since sliced bread!! Even though my C was scary because of my medical condition, the entire process was just magical. Birth is birth no matter how you slice it (no pun intended) Now, going into my 3rd c-section and even if I COULD delivery normally I would opt for \"C\". :0)Christina",

Tried to be supermom afterwards and that just prolonged my recovery. 2nd c-section: water broke 3 days early and baby won't drop again, so another non-emergency c-section. Took it much easier afterwards, napped when baby napped, recovery was much faster. A positive attitude and a good doctor are key. Good luck to everyone with their c-sections. Plus, my doctor said that c-sections help reduce the chances of incontinence in later life.",
