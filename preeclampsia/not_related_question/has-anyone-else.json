            "answer": "I'm currently 24 weeks and my hubby will be leaving next month to Hawaii for work. He won't be back till beginning of September and my due date is September 21st. Its hard knowing he will be leaving us for the first time, I have 2 other kids and he was here for the entire pregnancy and birth. So it is hard not knowing if he'll make it for birth time. The only that's easing that feeling is my family support and the fact that its a very well paid job and we need that money. Hopefully its just a temporary feeling.",

His family lives where we do but do not really show any interest in anything to do with me or my pregnancy even though I have with him for over 14 years. So I feel like I will be all alone because I don't really have friends outside of work. So I just feel like I will be all alone.",

    "question": "Has anyone else have their partner leave for work some where else half way through their pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0I find it really emotional that I am almost 25 weeks and he will not be back until I am atleast 35 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I know it has to do with hormones a lot because he was a truck driver before I got pregnant, and he was gone for months on end. I have gotten so used to him being home for the majority of this pregnancy. Sorry for the little rant, just wondering if anyone has any advice. Thank you ahead of time.",
