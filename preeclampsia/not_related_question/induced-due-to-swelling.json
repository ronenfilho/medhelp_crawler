The labor and delivery unit at my hospital says the doctors don't really look too much into preeclampsia with swelling any more, they told me its just part of pregnancy, my bp was fine and no protein in my urine, so it was completely ruled out for me. I was also told it can take up to 2 weeks for the swelling to do completely away after baby is born. Good luck !",
