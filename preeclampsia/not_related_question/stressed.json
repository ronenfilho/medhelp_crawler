            "answer": "I'm sorry about your extra stress. I understand your frustration with bed rest. I'm 37w/4d and on bed rest for my blood pressure and preeclampsia. I've only been on bed rest for the past week and I feel like I'm going to go crazy. I feel lazy and still have so much left to get ready for my bub and I'm not aloud and the stress isn't helping my blood pressure and the constant worrying doesn't help. I only have 2 weeks to go before they induce me because of my preeclampsia but just try to stay relaxed and rest. Good Luck!!",

            "answer": "That is very stressful. I am so sorry to hear that you have to go through that. Bed rest is hard enough but to have to worry about someone breaking in.... if it makes you feel better , they usually don't return to the scene of the crime. Last thing you need is stress. I know its easier said then done but try to relax. Good luck with your pregnancy.",
