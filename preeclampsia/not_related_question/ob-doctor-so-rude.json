I woke up with a headache, major swelling in one leg, mind you my appointment was at 8am, I go there and my blood pressure was 150/84 which is high for me.. I was in the ultrasound room for at least 30 minutes because he wasn't active. So doctor comes in and I ask so can we change my induction to 37 weeks instead of 38?? (Originally 37 weeks for induction) and he brought up well he can have ADHD if born at 37 weeks... Then goes to tell me (a 19 yr old ftm) that I'm still at risk for a still born! Um???? Wow why did you tell me that? He is so fixed on my son being too big but won't work with me? He tells me to come into the hospital (35 minutes away) if i have swelling, headaches and what not but when I see him he isn't concerned? Gosh I just wanna scream at him!!!",
