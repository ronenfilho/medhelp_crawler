It's\u00a0\u00a0just like stroke symptoms, so god help me if I ever do have a stroke because I will think it's a migraine. I get all of those exact symptoms and constantly throw up, and sometimes the symptoms will last for three days. It's miserable, especially now that I'm pregnant again and can't take my typical pain medicine. I would recommend getting phenergan, it eases nausea, but also will help you sleep off the migraine which seems to be the only cure for them.",

    "question": "So yesterday I started feeling really weird! Almost like tunnel vision or if u black out and just start to come too. But I never blacked out! My bp was great just a bit high for me it was 106/62 my hr was 99. Yes I have low pressure and fast hr always have. But after about 30 min of the drunk feeling and tunnel vision started I was on the phone with my mom and my speech started to slur. Then I couldn't remember or even think of how to say a word. Then I noticed my whole right side head face mouth hand arm leg everything was numb. To the point I couldn't even hold a pen to write a number down. Then the headache kicked in it was almost as bad as a migrane. This morning I got up and my vision is still weird its like I have stared in a bright light for a long time. The kinda sparkle look after. And the headache is still there but not as bad! My ob wanted me to go to ER and get checked for a stroke but I'm hard headed and plus the flu is going around real bad and didn't want my daughter up there around all the sick people in the ER. My baby has been moving really good so I'm not so much worried about him. But my question is: Has anyone else had this happen and if so what was the cause! I'm 35+3 due feb 1 by section!",
