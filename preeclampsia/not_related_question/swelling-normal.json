    "question": "I know some swelling is normal during pregnancy. But last night my hands and feet just randomly swelled up? I havent had this issue this pregnancy. But its steadily gotten worse (i had to take off my wedding ring because it was cutting off circulation) since it started last night. Still normal?I was pre eclamptic with my first but i dont remember if my swelling started like this or not. I just took a cranberry tablet to see if it would help flush out the excess water. But is sudden swelling that progressively gets worse normal?",
