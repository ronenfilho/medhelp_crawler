But I do think that there are exceptions like preeclampsia, baby way too big to fit in pelvic, etc.... The Dr push it too much to. It's a convenience thing not what's in the best interest of mother and child. Baby will come when baby is ready.",

If you are breastfeeding for a year you will have a child teething on you like a biscuit. I don't get the rush. I hate hate hate being pregnant... Absolutely hate it ...but I don't want to rush her out before she's ready. Your baby comes at their perfect time if that's early or late. So stop drinking nastt stuff eating stuff and bouncing on balls ( all ways ;).) Just enjoy yourself or ur other kids before this one gets here .",
