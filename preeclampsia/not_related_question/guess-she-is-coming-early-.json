Im original c section date was may 15th but my levels are extremely high so doctor is taking her early. Normallevels are 28-141 mg in 24 hrs, mine were 372 mg. Preeclampsia isn't go for mom or baby if left untreated. My sister didndidn't know she had it till she went into labor at 33 weeks. She gained 50 lbs of water weight alone. Ended up having a heart attack at 16 because they didn't catch it in time. My son and dad both passed away from heart problems so she isn't taking any chances",
