I learned later there were things the hospital could have done to help that,but didn't do. I was heartbroken. I didnt want the c section at all. I was very forceful with my decision to have that VBAC the 2nd time. I am SO glad I did. People are under the impression that c sections are easier.\u00a0\u00a0Which is a load of crap. Plainly put.... As women, our bodies are designed for birth.\u00a0\u00a0As human beings were not meant to be sliced open! (Obviously in emergencies thats different) the recovery for my cesarean was long and painful. The natural birth I was messed up for like...a week ...maybe. if that!Have them let you try to push the baby out. My baby that I pushed out after my c section was even bigger and longer than the one I \"needed\" a csection with.He was 9lbs 5oz and 22 1\\2 inches long.Im 10weeks with number 3 and hoping for another natural birth!I believe in you!Feel free to message me and ask me any questions!",
