I know I\u00a0\u00a0always hear that and I always worry about gaining too much. I figure if the doctors werent concern then its okay. I herd that in the last month (your current month) you should be gaining a pound a week.",

    "question": "So I'm 37 weeks today, yay only 3 weeks to go!(: but yesterday I had a doc appt and the past 3 appt's I've weighed 144 and it's been over 5 weeks and I haven't gained anything. My doc didn't say anything about it, but it concerns me. Is it normal to not gain as much towards the end? I forgot to ask her bc she checked for dilation for the first time and was talking about contractions. Thanks",
