            "answer": "You don't want to make it go faster, 34 weeks is still VERY early regardless of the steroid shots and if born now he will likely be in the NICU and have breathing/swallowing problems. Stress is hard, but pregnancy isn't about having that child to fit our schedule, it's about giving them the best chances. It's not comfortable, and it never will be. There's a child pressing up against every organ and your body, and the pressure it adds on your lower limbs is unbearable at times. I spent my entire pregnancy vomiting 24/7 and when I wasn't, I was nauseated and praying I wouldn't be sick. He'll come when he's ready to come, even though you might already be.",

So let's try and get you further along.\"Hang in there.",

            "answer": "the last few weeks are always hard on your body, take rest when you can and if poss lie on our left side as this gets optimum blood flow to your bub. Also start drinking chamomile T, it can be an aquired taste but if you can get about 5 cups a day into you it does work wonders at relaxing\u00a0\u00a0you, if you dont like the taste put a t-spoon of honey in it, also bach flo wer remedys can do wonder, rescue remedy is good, just a couple of drops under your tounge or in water and than can be of help as well. . I know it can be hard to try not to stress but your baby will thank you for it as sometimes when the mum is stressed alot, you can have a very stressed baby when born due to all the adrenalin, I hope some of this is helpful to you",
