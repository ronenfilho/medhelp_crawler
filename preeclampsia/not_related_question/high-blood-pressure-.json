My blood pressure has been pretty high since week 34 so they are inducing me next week at 39 weeks though to be safe. Cord pressure on baby has been fine though so baby hasn't seemed affected by my high levels. Dr said its my placenta giving off weird hormones making me get hypertension, its not my fault.",

Probably did it at least 15 times. It sucked but never once did it come out not normal. Everything was always just fine. Don't worry about it too much it should all be fine! Good luck.",
