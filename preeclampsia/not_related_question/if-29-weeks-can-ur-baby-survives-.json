            "answer": "Hello,No doctor will induce you at 29 weeks unless you were having severe preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Even then they would try to delay you for a few days if they could to give steroids to help the baby's lungs mature.A baby born at 29 weeks could definitely get serious complications and even may not survive.\u00a0\u00a0A baby born at 29 weeks will have problems breathing (a baby has best chance if they make it past 32 weeks or even better past 36 weeks or to full term).The best thing for your baby is for you to hang in there as long as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Term is consisered at 37 weeks, but better for the baby to be 38+ weeks.The last 8 - 9 weeks will be hard, but this is what your baby needs to be fully baked and as strong as possible before it is born.",

            "answer": "I agree, no doctor will induce just because you're in pain. The baby would have to be in severe distress or you would have to have major problems to even come close. You should never wish to have your baby 11 weeks early. They're very small in weight, can't breathe on their own, and will be in the NICU on breathing machines and feeding tubes for several weeks.Pregnancy isn't comfortable, and isn't easy. I spent my entire 9 months vomiting multiple times everyday and unable to eat or drink much. I was anemic, extremely weak and exhausted. However, we can't evict because we're tired. Put their best interests first, which involves them staying put as long as possible.",
