            "answer": "Actually based on your symptoms you might have preeclampsia. How high is your blood pressure? Did your midwife do a dipstick urine test? Did proteins show up? If your symptoms persist you should go to a doctor to start treatment for your condition. I don't want to scare you but if you do have preeclampsia it can be life threatening both for you and your baby. I was diagnosed with it 3 weeks ago, refused hospitalization and am on home bed rest. Since then everything is OK but I am monitoring myself at home several times a day (blood pressure and proteins in urine). I am now 37 weeks, so even I would need to be induced we'd both be fine.",

            "answer": "Just look up on google preeclampsia (it's some sci-fi stuff - doctors have bo idea what causes it), but if your pee was OK (no proteins) and your BP is not constantly over 140/90 even when resting, then you don't have it. But because preeclampsia can set on out of the blue, and there's not much you can do about it, I would go to a doctor's office/hospital and ask for a 24h urine test plus 24 BP monitoring - that's the only way to make sure of you have it or not. I am having weekly appointments at the hospital and doing daily urine dipstick tests at home to check for protein levels and at least 4 BP readings daily myself. If any of the above go out of range I was told my dr to call her on her cell phone immediately.",
