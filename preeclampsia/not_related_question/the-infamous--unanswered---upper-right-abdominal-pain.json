            "answer": "Stomach acid to essential for health.\u00a0\u00a0You need enough of hydrochloric (HCI) acid digest essential nutrient, and kill off bacteria, fungi and parasites. If you are taking acid blockers, which i assume you would be for GERD, the black box warning for proton pump inhibitors (eg: nexium, prilosec) is magnesium deficiency. That is one of the many nutrient deficiency states that will occur with low stomach acid.Magnesium is the most important co factor for vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0In a study of 150 patients referred to a clinic in Minnesota for the evaluation of persistent muscle and bone pain, 93% had vitamin D deficiency.My mother is free of severe GERD, severe LPR (suffered both for 5 years) and 95% improved with gastritis (25 years / 5 years severe pain). She increased her stomach acid (yes increased! since acid lowers with age and many other medical conditions eg: hypothyroidism) with betaine HCI with pepsin suppplements and takes digestive enyzmes which are great to help prevent acid reflux. The proteases (enzymes that digest protein) heal gastritis. GERD and LPR were gone within weeks and gastritis improved over a year. She also has a hiatus hernia but these supplements still do the trick. :)Excerpts from Easy immune Health - Signs of magnesium deficiency..\"Signs of Magnesium DeficiencyPainful conditions can be due to magnesium deficiency. Especially conditions that are due to tenseness and tightness- even if you don't know that you are tense or tight, if you have these pain conditions, it's likely that you are.Conditions like:Muscle CrampsChronic Back PainMigrainesMuscular PainTendonitisSimilarly, patients with diagnoses of depression, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, tremor, Parkinsonism, arrhythmias, circulatory disturbances (stroke, cardiac infarction, arteriosclerosis), hypertension, migraine, cluster headache, cramps, neuro-vegetative disorders, abdominal pain, osteoporosis, asthma, stress dependent disorders, tinnitus, ataxia, confusion, preeclampsia, weakness, might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome.Full blown health problems, and not just minor problems, can ALSO be magnesium deficiency symptoms\u00a0\u00a0and most people with health problems benefit greatly from a high Magnesium Dosage therapy.Diseases such as:Heart DiseaseAtrial FibrillationHypertension or high blood pressureHeart PalpitationsOsteoporosis (yes, osteoporosis! See the page on Calcium With Magnesium to see why magnesium is MORE important than calcium for bone health.)DiabetesSudden Death in patients with Congestive Heart FailureFibromyalgia and MagnesiumChronic Fatigue SyndromeKidney StonesIn almost all of these disorders, signs of magnesium deficiency were apparent long before the disease struck but with few medical professionals knowledgeable about the magnesium deficiency symptoms, no one is there to catch these diseases before they happen.\"",

    "question": "Lets go way back to around 1989. Started having lower left and middle abdoninal pain. In and out of ER;s for about 6yrs and to OB/GYN'S. All tests came back normal and would be diagnosed with anything to get me out the door. Pain meds and send me home. Finally Found someone to perform a laparoscopy which revealed ALOT of adhesions where my left fallopion tube, ovary and the whole left side of my uterus was attatched to my abdominal wall. Plus my cervix was almost completely closed from scar tissue! I also had a condition called adenomyosis - a form of endometriosis. The pain was real! Scar tissue was from a c-section in 1988. Fast forward to around 2002. upper right abdominal pain. Hyda scans, ultrasounds, came back normal. I started swelling and tests were repeated. Pain still nagging. Blood work normal excpt foor one thing. If I remember right, my alkaline phosphatase? was barely raised. This is a year in to this. GI doc says okay enough, I think it is your gallbladder and we have it taken out along with hiatal hernia surgery. It was diseased and my liver was inflamed as well! Now, 8 months later January 16, 2004 ( My first Grandbabies birthday!)\u00a0\u00a0same symptoms, I have to have an ERCP done. Sure enough - pressures are 100 and a stent is put in. I have since found out that the stent is gone - vanished.\u00a0\u00a0Never removed. My point? Tests aren't always reliable. But I know my own body and when it is in pain, When it hurts and whenever something is REALLY WRONG! In ALL of these cases the tests were wrong, but I knew how I felt. My question to you?What the heck is wrong with me now? In the last three years I have passed 5 Kidney stones. I have a lump or maybe two now in my upper right abdominal area, below my rib cage, The pain is pretty severe, gripping and goes all the way through to my back. Yes, they have ran all the standard tests, ct's blood work, x-rays ultrasounds - all negative until recenly. One Dr. said I had a small hernia and then another from the same ER said there was no evidence from the very same ct scan!My Primary care says the lump is a lipoma and ny GI says hemangioma and it is huge (says he can feel it and he doesn't need to see a ct scan) and that it needs to come out now! That was two weeks ago and surgery consult isn't until January 2013. But, wouldn't that have shown up on ct anyway? One other thing, all blood work usually comes back normal but tonight in ER my liver enzymes were up. Abdminal pain, ALWAYS presents with severe nausea but i am unable to throw up due to hiatal hernia surgery.History - Type I Diabetic, mini strokes, migraines, peripheral neuropathy, asthma, possible gastoparesis, GERD, gastritis (treating all)I also suffer from severe deep bone pain that I don't unferdtand at all, Most of it is in my arms bit now it is in my legs. Also have a protien defiecency and low albumin? okay thats all I think.
