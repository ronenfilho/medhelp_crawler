            "answer": "Sorry to hear you are ill, but at least you know what it is and can take action to get well.Yes, it's curable, but for some people it's a long road, perhaps because of the particular variety of the Lyme bacteria that the person has, or because of co-infections that the same ticks carry.\u00a0\u00a0Every one is different.Did your MD prescribe any supplements to go with the antibiotics?\u00a0\u00a0Magnesium supplements can be very helpful against the twitches and muscles aches, so ask your MD if you can take them.I see you've posted another message, too, so I'll go there as well.Take care.",

            "answer": "PROCEDURE: Sagittal T1. Axial T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusionCOMPARISON: CT from 2008FINDINGS: There is symmetric focal T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusioninvolving only the splenium of corpus callosum. The brain is otherwise normalin signal intensity on all pulse sequences. No hemorrhage, mass effect,extra-axial collection. The basilar flow-voids are present. The calvarium,skull base, craniocervical relationships, and visualized extracranialstructures are remarkable for mild mucoperiosteal thickening and polypoidchange in the paranasal sinuses.IMPRESSION: Isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosumis quite unusual in a patient without known history of multiple sclerosis,traumatic diffuse axonal injury, or status epilepticus. Consider drugtoxicity, transient metabolic derangement, encephalitis or ADEM, PML, rareneoplasm, or hypoglycemia. Doubt hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or posteriorreversible encephalopathy in the absence of known preeclampsia/eclampsia.",

            "answer": "Well, you're beyond everything I am familiar with, and to my knowledge no one here is medically trained.\u00a0\u00a0They seem to be saying there is a finding that is 'quite unusual' if you don't have MS, epilepsy or a particular kind of injury, and that your MD should think about whether you have high levels of some toxic drug, your metabolism is temporarily out of whack, your brain is swollen, low blood sugar, or a couple of other things.\u00a0\u00a0I would read it to mean the MD reading the test doesn't know and is tossing it back to your MD, but you have to check with your MD on that.I will say that MRIs, from what I read, may not be helpful in diagnosing Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0My LLMD ordered a SPECT scan instead of an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0A SPECT scan looks for how the blood is or is not flowing to and through the brain, and having areas of low blood flow may be consistent with Lyme inflammation and infection.\u00a0\u00a0I recall that my SPECT scan was pretty impressive -- as in, I was very ill and it showed up on the test.The problem is (as I understand it) that nonLLMDs don't often think of using a SPECT scan, because the nonLLMDs are looking for problems other than Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0I did have an MRI, by the way, done by a highly respected neurologist at a fancy medical teaching center.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't find anything interesting and certainly the word 'Lyme' or 'inflammation' never passed his lips.What's your next planned step, after seeing your MD?",
