            "answer": "With my pregnancy with my daughter i was diagnosed with preeclampsia. They induced me at 35 weeks and the entire time i was in labor they ran magnesium sulfate through my IV. By far the worst labor i could ever imagined having. The doctors and nurses came in just about every hour until i delivered and kept continually montering me. I was not allowed to eat or drink anything at all until 24 hours after i delivered. I would talk to your doctor and see their protocol on preeclampsia because its definitely not something to get blind sided into like i was. Hope all goes well!",
