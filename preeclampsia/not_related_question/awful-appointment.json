    "question": "I went in to my appointment expecting to be told I failed my one hour glucose test, and I walked out not only failing that, but being diagnosed with severe anemia and getting an appointment with a cardiologist. My doctor was very concerned seeing my resting heart rate is 118 today and telling him i have been experiencing racing heart rates and shortness of breath anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. I m curious if anyone has experienced these kind of heart problems and been put on bed rest. I had early onset of gestational diabetes with my son at 15 weeks so i know what to expect from that. I'm 27 weeks Sunday, and being put on bed rest with a 3 year old is my worst fear.",
