            "answer": "You have to think about those risk being so small. Even giving birth vaginally can have complications you just have to stay positive. Going in for an emergency c section and having one planned are different. Having one planned means everyone is ready for you and things will be so much more calm good luck mama",

            "answer": "As much as they do them now days the chances of dying are not that high. I'm having one on the 9th also my second after having an emergency one with my first. As long as there are no problems you will be awake the while time, it's not that bad. I was awake with my first one. Everything will be fine. This is coming from the girl who thought she was going to die from getting her tonsils out 2 years before getting pregnant for the first time( i still have my tonsils by the way!) I my self can't figure why I freaked out about having my tonsils out but now I'm having a second baby! Make sure to talk about this with your Dr before going to the hospital, he may be able to help you out better and don't feel stupid, we all have our own fears about something",

I am so scared.\u00a0\u00a0I probably sound dumb for being scared, but I really am.. my husband keeps saying I'll be fine and what not, but does that really happen to a lot of women?",
