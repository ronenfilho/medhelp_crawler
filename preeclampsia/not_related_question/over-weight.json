            "answer": "I started at 145 pounds and I have very few health problems, ie my stomach makes too much acid, I have asthma, etc. Nothing that would threaten baby.In my first trimester I dropped to 125 pounds. In my second ttrimester, I got back up to 139 then lost nine pounds in a week. It's been one month and I'm now 149 pounds.I don't think weight is too much to worry about, and is not very reliable. If I were to consider my overall weight gain as opposed to pre-pregnancy, I've only gained 4 pounds. But from my first trimester, when I dropped to 125, I've gained almost 25 pounds.Take it with a grain of salt and stick to your vitamins, and remember that your doctor will let you know if you're outside a healthy range.",

            "answer": "Your dr shouldn't make you feel bad over 2 pounds. :\\ Your body weight fluctuates by a few pounds ANYWAY due to water, if you've eaten, had a bowel movement, etc. 2 pounds is nothing so if she gets crazy upset over that, I'd find another doctor. :(Don't go on a crazy diet. Actually, don't diet at all. Baby needs a full diet and a pregnant woman should have around 300 extra calories since she has to share.Don't feel bad lol I'm overweight and was told I couldn't gain ANY weight AT ALL. I'm 22+4 and dropped 15lbs just from eating smaller meals and portion sizes. They medically HAVE to tell/warn you because you are statistically more likely to have things like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes if you're overweight. Doesn't mean you WILL. So just eat healthy, don't fret, and consider a new doctor if it makes you more comfortable. :)",
