            "answer": "I did the same thing with my first baby. I was SO miserable. I couldn't take a shower longer than 6 minutes or I would ache and swell up so bad. I had to have cool water because heat made it worse. Surprisingly though, I didn't have preeclampsia. I had swelling in my legs, hands, feet, face, wrists. The most miserable I had ever been in my life lolI retained a lot of fluid. Drinking a ton of water does actually help though. Keep your feet cool. Whether it's in an air conditioned room or what\u00a0\u00a0have you. I feel your pain. I didn't swell much with my second baby. And I'm on my 3rd now so I'm hoping it doesn't get bad like baby #1.",
