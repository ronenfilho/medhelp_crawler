They don't think I have preeclampsia cos the blood results don't indicate I do, but they are still monitoring me incase that changes. It's always good to have a doctor that is willing to do the extra work to make sure you and Bub are fine. As I said, the fact I have protein in my urine is reason enough to be monitored just as a precaution. Maybe you should speak your concerns to your doctor.",

I had midwives and\u00a0\u00a0I had my baby at a birth center, so things are a little more lax if you know what I mean. They didnt seem worried but I was scared because my feet were balloons and I saw the per stick results myself. The fact my bp was bad, unless I was laying down, was really what freaked me out. Everything turned out fine though. I was on mild bed rest the last few weeks. I had to prop my feet up all the time and eat lots of protein and drink tons of water (sounds counter-productive but it actually helps) and I went into labor naturally on week 39. Im sure you'll be fine too. Just be careful and drink that water and eat that cottage cheese!",

Now I am worried I have preeclamcia and the doctor isn't taking it serious enough. I have been swollen for a week. My husband want to take me to a hospital. Anyone else experience anything like this? I'll be 37 weeks this weekend.",
