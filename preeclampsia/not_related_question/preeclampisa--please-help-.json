            "answer": "You don't have to have everything on the symptom list to have it. I only had 3 signs of it and I had it. I had high bp, high protein and swelling(which can be normal for any pregnancy) I did not even know I had the swelling until the Dr said I did. So even if you don't have the high bp right now but have other things on the list then you will prob still be induced. I had my daughter at 38 weeks cause of it and my SO was born at 30 weeks cause his mom had it when she was pregnant with him.",
