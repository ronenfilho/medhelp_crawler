    "question": "I'm 27 weeks today and my hands and feel have been swelling pretty bad for the last couple weeks. I know swelling is common in pregnancy, but is it common this early? I've heard that major swelling can be a possible sign of preeclampsea. My mom had preeclampsea when she had me and i was born 2 months early so i dont want to take any chances. I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday and will be talking to them about it, I just want to know if anyone else dealt with swelling this early?",
