            "answer": "I got induced the day i was 39 weeks with my son but that was because i wanted to be and 39 weeks is the earliest they are allowed to induce without a medical reason so your baby should be fine or they would be inducing sooner than that he might just think it will be easier on you to get the baby out a week early but trust me you will be thankful by the time you make it to 39 weeks your being induced! Now i will tell you i was very scared to get the epidural i was not going to but if you are getting induced and dont want one trust me you will change your mind, being induced makes contractions much more intense and makes labor much more painful.",

I'mhaving them induce me cuz the u/s have been showing that he is gona be good sized, I've been measuring big, and I'm so swelled it hurts to stand for 5minutes. This is my 4th child and have been induced with all\u00a0\u00a0of then cuz once I was in laborI wasn't progressing or dilating enough. No epidurals with any of them",

            "answer": "My opinion Is that your doctor Is juss takin' precautions. I'm bein' Induced In 4 days at 39 weeks due to Mild Preeclampsia. This Is my first so I can't give out an experience, but I would loveeeee to know how others went! I don't want an epidural but I've heard that bein' Induced makes the contractions and labor period much worse, but I'm gonna try not to get one. Bbygrl1269, you are my role model! I hope I can be as strong as you without havin' an epi! =-]",

            "answer": "I did actually for an epi with my youngest sonbut it was too late to get it.\u00a0\u00a0he kept turning and wrapping the cord around his neck tighter. The more he turned\u00a0\u00a0the tighter the cord got and the worse the contractions felt. They contractions were measuring a 3 on the chart but felt like a 10. Just hope and pray that you or any one else does not have to go thru that. Im still not sure how i managed but i did. Then was in shock when i saw him cuz his neck & head were black...almost as dark as a black tshirt. But so far he is my miracle baby cuz he ended up in NICU for about 3wks due to cord being so tight around his neck, rapid heartbeat, jaundice, and having trouble digesting food",

            "answer": "I was induced with my first because she was over due. I did not change my mind and went through the whole experience with out regretting refusing the epidural. Blakeandgraciesmom, I don't particularly think you should be taking that hope away from ftms. Not everyone's experiences are the same so you shouldn't take advantage of the trust a new mom will place in your words.",

My older brother had the same Issue with the cord wrapped around his neck, my mom told me when he came out, he was sooooo blue and purple he didn't even look like he was alive, no cries or nothin' for the longest time, my mom thought the worst, but he turned out perfectly fine In the end, thank God. I had very bad Jaundice when I was a baby, had to stay at the hospital for the longest time under a light (sorry, not sure what It's called) then when I was able to go home, had to be In the sun for a few hours a day. So I'm scared my baby Is gonna have somethin' go wrong, but gotta have faith, right? I'm juss hoping he'll be okay and I won't be a wus and get an epidural!",

            "answer": "It is very scary when something like that happens. I didn't know what to think cuz they didn't put him right on my belly like they did with my other 2. They took him immediately out of the room to check him and make sure he was ok. When they did bring him back in and i saw him for the 1st time i really wasnt sure if i wanted to hold him or not. I was scared and didnt know what to think. He will be 8 on the 22nd and is doing wonderful. He's been off all the heart meds since he was 1&1/2 but i was told the heart condition can come back. Other than that, you cant even tell that he was born with a heart condition",
