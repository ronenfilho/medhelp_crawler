            "answer": "Depends on the reason really. Induction because you're sick of being pregnant or because your doctor will be on vacation? Not the best. Induction because you have preeclampsia and it's dangerous for both you and baby to remain pregnant? Good. (Mind you these are the extremes)For induction till be successful, you need to have a high enough bishop score (Google it). Your baby needs to be low in your pelvis, head down and hopefully anterior. You need to be given sufficient time! (Some hospitals or providers get impatient and move you into surgery for \"failure to progress\" even if baby wasn't ready to come and you're making slow progress).Cytotec is still used in a lot of hospitals and it can be very dangerous for you and baby. (I have a journal on Cytotec on my profile). Pitocen can cause baby distress because it causes unnaturally strong contractions. So strong that a lot of moms on \"pit\" end up with an epidural because of the intensity. If it's bad enough you NEED an epidural (rather than just wanting one), imagine how rough it is for your baby!Induction isn't a bad thing if done for the right reasons. But unless it's medically necessary, I'd say the risks outweigh the benefits. (And I've had a medically necessary induction!)",
