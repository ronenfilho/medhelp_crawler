            "answer": "My last ultrasound was at 31 weeks.I won't know the weight of my baby until she's born.Like emommy said... Most don't get anymore after the 20 week mark. That's just how it is. They measure your stomach which can give them an idea of how big your baby will be. They can also press on your stomach and feel where your baby is, so they'll be able to tell you if they're head down. Another ultrasound really isn't necessary.",

            "answer": "Well if you are not comfortable with the doctor then change but keep in mind this far along you may have trouble finding a new doctor to take you on or may get a worse doctor.I was forced to change doctors with my first at 30 weeks due to moving out of state and the doctor treated me like I was nothing....didn't need to get to know me because I was on with her for the last 10 weeks!Now as far as what you in your post.....baby's weight....i only new the weight when I had an ultrasound...other then that the doctor would always tell me if I was measuring on point (each appointment they measured my belly!If baby being head down yet....depending on how far you are....they usually don't worry about baby being head down until about 36 weeks....Once you start going for your weekly appointments the doctor will feel (they will do a belly exam and can feel if baby is head down) for position. ...and then do your internal exam (which will tell them your dialation, thinning, and also baby position)!Also don't be afraid to ask or discuss your concerns....sometimes doctors get I to a routine with patients and then they forget you are a first time mom!Best of luck hun!",

            "answer": "That seems normal. My last ultrasound was at 22 weeks which was my gender one. I wasn't even told the weight then. Just that my baby was a healthy baby boy. I asked my doctor if I would have another ultrasound and she said unless they think something is wrong they usually don't do another. And when I was 34 weeks I had guessed my baby had turned head down due to more activity in my ribs and she checked by pressing on my tummy. I had a student in the room so She even explained what to feel for and how to tell which way he was facing. I don't think based on those reasons you would need to change doctors. Especially so late in the game. Just ands and set your next appointment.",

I have to have one done every month because my placenta is sitting too low, but they try to make it aa quick as possible. The doctor can feel with his or her hands if your baby is in the right position. Its a good sign if you don't need multiple ultrasounds.",

With my last one I only had extra ultrasounds when I had preeclampsia at 8 months. I know its frustrating to not see your baby more but your Dr has delivered many babies and usually they know what they're doing. I know its impossible but try to relax and have faith. Being a ftm is hard and scary but the schedule the Dr has for you is common as far as I can tell. As nice as it is to see my baby again I wish I didn't have to because it means everything isn't perfect. Does that make sense?",
