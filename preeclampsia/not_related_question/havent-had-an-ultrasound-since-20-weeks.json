            "answer": "Same here. I am a ftm and haven't had an ultrasound since 20 weeks, and right now I'm 35+6. I have also been curious as to whether or not my baby is head down, or of everything is okay because it has been over 3 months since the ultrasound. What makes it worse is that during my last appt I found out that I may have preeclampsia since my blood pressure was slightly above normal, so during my next appt they're going to run some tests to see whether I need to be induced. Is there any way you can request another ultrasound for your next appt?",
