            "answer": "I'm nearly 22 weeks with my second and the edema has started to kick in. Right now it's mainly in my legs.with my first by the time I gave birth I had so much fluid that my maternity charts state that I lost 5 kgs of fluid through urine in the first 24 hrs (I had a catheter so it had to be measured).The one thing I've found to really help it is swimming as when I go swimming I'm nowhere near as swollen a couple of hrs later.",
