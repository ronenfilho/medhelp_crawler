            "answer": "I was induced at 39 weeks with my first as I had preeclampsia my symptoms were bad enough to induce me. I had very bad swelling in my feet, hands and face. High blood pressure and headaches. The final factor that made me be induced was protein in my urine. They had watched me for many weeks. It doesn't mean you need a c section. I'm currently 37 weeks and have been monitored for preeclampsia since 30 weeks. My blood pressure is higher than it was last time, I have swelling again, headaches, blurred vision and trace amounts of protein in my urine. If that goes up I'll be induced again. I get bloods usually every week and pee on a special stick. Hope it works out okay for you xx",
