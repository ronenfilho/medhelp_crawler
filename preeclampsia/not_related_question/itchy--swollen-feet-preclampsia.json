    "question": "My feet and hands are starting to swell more often now. Im 37 weeks. The swelling goes down when I get off my feet. And the heat doesn't help so I try to cool down. Is this a normal pregnancy thing? My feet are also itchy. Not severe tho.My blood pressure has been fine & urine fine as well... Could it still be preclampsia if those two things have been normal?",
