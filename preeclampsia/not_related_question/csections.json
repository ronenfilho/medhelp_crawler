            "answer": "I highly respect a cesarean delivery!! I probably wouldn't have been able to be a mother had it not been for such an operation!! I due for my 7th cesarean delivery the 16th of (originally the 17th but got rescheduled). I had 6 completely successful and healthy cesarean deliveries!! I no longer fear the outcome or the C-section itself, I actually have a dislike for the spinal tap other then that the surgery in general to me is a blessing!! The first cesarean delivery is difficult when it comes to recovery but after that generally speaking, it gets easier. More so because you know what to expect and how to handle each and every issue as it occurs. I am a bit nervous about my 7th cesarean delivery but because I am so worried about the baby and common complications that some time occur, like the baby ingesting fluid and needing extra time in a nursery or NICU. Other then that, I am very much ready!!! I plan on having one more child on s few years, definitely not back to back like my other children. My first born passed away (none birth related), but she was born in 2004. At home I have a 7 year old, almost 6 year old, 4 and a half year old, 3 year old and a 14 month old. I am 35 weeks. I personally think if a cesarean delivery is best for your situation as it was mine, then by all means be thankful that you get to deliver in general!! I hope your delivery goes well with no complications!! Blessings!",
