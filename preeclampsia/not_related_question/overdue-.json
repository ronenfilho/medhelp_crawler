            "answer": "I was induced with my daughter and everyone kept telling me it made the contractions worse and increased my chances of having to have a c section and would make my labor last longer than normal. All LIES! I am a huge wimp and I didn't even notice my contractions until I was 6-7 cm dilated. I was only in labor 4 1/2 hours and I delivered vaginally. I also did all of that with no medications. Sex also brings on labor. Oh and if you have a labor/yoga ball bouncing on that will help out too.",

            "answer": "I was also induced and my friend today as well. Our labors were both the exact same time length (8 hours) and it was really not that bad at all! I got an epidural at 5cm but that was mainly because I was bed stricken (had severe preeclampsia and group strep b so had a cathedar in and on medicine thru an iv to prevent seizures and antibiotics since i had group b strep lol) I really do think I could have sucked it up and went longer if I would have been able to get out of bed. Its really not bad at all. Dont stress about it :) good luck and early congrats!",
