Long story short I had preaclympica which I'm finding out now that I am pregnant again 11 yes later. My platelets were dropping. After 72 hours of no progression they find out that because I had my cervix frozen due to pre cancerous cells. I was not going to diolate. Had to be put under general. Couldn't see my son for 12 hours. 6 hrs he had to be on oxygen 6 hrs to watch him. Then they pressed down with their hand to see if my uterus went down right were they cut me open now epidural or pain meds mind you. Worst pain of my life. They put me on morphine drip. It was about 2 months of pain can't go up and down stairs for awhile. Hopefully when I deliver this time it would be much better.",
