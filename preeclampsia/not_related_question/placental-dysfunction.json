            "answer": "I can't really give you MY advice because I don't know anything about this.. But I am going to give you my prayers.. Im so sorry that your pregnancy is going badly for you. I hope that things start to get better.. But this is what i found on Healthopedia.\u00a0\u00a0Hope it helps.Placental insufficiency is the failure of the placenta to supply nutrients to the fetus and remove toxic wastes.What is going on in the body?When the placenta fails to develop or function properly, the fetus cannot grow and develop normally. The earlier in the pregnancy that this occurs, the more severe the problems. If placental insufficiency occurs for a long time during the pregnancy, it may lead to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).What are the causes and risks of the condition?Between 3 to 7% of all pregnancies are complicated by IUGR due to placental insufficiency. A low birth weight may be suspected if the size of the woman's uterus is smaller than what is expected for each week of pregnancy. The woman has a higher risk of having a child with IUGR if the following are present:defects of the placental membranesdefects of the umbilical cordabnormal implantation of the placenta in the uterusa break in the placental membrane that causes the baby's blood to mix with the mother's bloodRh incompatibility, a condition in which the mother's blood is not compatible with the baby's bloodbeing pregnant with twins or tripletsprevious low-birth-weight infantlong-term high blood pressurediabetessevere kidney diseaseheavy smokinginsufficient weight gain by the mother during pregnancy, defined as less than 10 poundspreeclampsia or eclampsia, conditions which raise the mother's blood pressurehigh altitudedrug addiction, such as addiction to cocaineblood thinners such as warfarinimmunosuppressive medicationshuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the motheralcohol abuseinfection with cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, or syphilis, known collectively as TORCH infectionspoor nutrition of the motherinfant with known birth defects or chromosome abnormalitiesfrequent vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta is attached to the uterus over or near the cervixcertain blood disorders in the mother, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemiapremature placental separation, known as placental abruption",

    "question": "I am at 25 weeks (Due Oct 21) and\u00a0\u00a0have spotted and passed clots throughout the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0This pregnancy has been troublesome from the start and I have been in bed so long that I am afraid that when I'm allowed up there is going to be a peminant dip in the matress.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I don't think that I've had an appt yet (either with my regular OB or the Specialist) that didn't deliver something else to worry over.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a slew of problems including spotting, clotting, randomly fainting (which is embarassing when it happens at an inoppertune time or place but apparently not that uncommen) a small abruption (scary but as of yesterday it isn't getting any worse), a sinal tear, I'm not really gaining any weight (which sounds good for me but not really for the baby), I'm RH- but that doesn't really mean anything other than it was something else that caused concern at the time, and I've started randomly contracting.\u00a0\u00a0So anyways, I just found out yesterday that I have placental dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0What is this??? How scary is it??\u00a0\u00a0I was kinda hoping that someone might have gone through some or all of this and could give me some advice.\u00a0\u00a0What I am really concerned about is the placental dysfunction (or placental insufficiency) and the contractions.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like as long as I'm in bed the bleeding is kept at a minimum and the abruption or tearing isn't getting any worse so that isn't my major concern at this time.\u00a0\u00a0What I am worried about it that my last ultrasound appt was four weeks ago and she was normal size but now she is 2 1/2 weeks behind in her growth.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something that is going to continue to get worse?\u00a0\u00a0Will she be okay?\u00a0\u00a0What are my chances of having a healthy baby?\u00a0\u00a0What are her chances of having a long healthy life?\u00a0\u00a0What kind of challenges am I looking at in the future both during the pregnancy and after she is born and I'm raising her?\u00a0\u00a0What can I do?\u00a0\u00a0What causes this?\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone answer any of this?\u00a0\u00a0I go back to the specialist next Thurs but when I asked her all these questions all she could say was she didn't know and that all they can do is monitor the progress and let the baby tell them when it's time to deliver.\u00a0\u00a0So my next question would be WHAT????\u00a0\u00a0What does that mean?\u00a0\u00a0Why can't she give me a better answer or a this is what to expect kind of answer?\u00a0\u00a0What is going on?In advance, thank you for any answers you can give me.\u00a0\u00a0Also thank you for any concerns and comments.",
