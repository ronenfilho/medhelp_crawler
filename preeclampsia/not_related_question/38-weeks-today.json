I'll be 39this Friday so well see how my cervix is today and decide if to have induction Friday or not.\u00a0\u00a0Though alot of ladies are against inducing and letting baby come natural. I have a feeling I would go past 40weeks because yes I have mild back cramping more braxton Hicks and a bit of vaginal preassure but I'm still like walking around shopping etc",

If baby comes before is early if after its late.\u00a0\u00a0 But I do understand how you ladies feel I was induced 3 times to hurry baby because I was uncomfortable... two of those times I begged like my life depended on it.\u00a0\u00a0With my 5 th baby I begged and my new Dr said no my midwife even begged with me for the Dr to approve it. I was mad then but he made the best call for me and baby.. I am glad he did now I would of had to give up giving birth at the birthing center and that was the best experience ever..\u00a0\u00a0if you can wait I suggest it but if you can't there is nothing wrong with that. Don't feel bad because people think you should wait because this is your labor. Your birthing experience...\u00a0\u00a0I hope your baby decides get a move on for y'all I am uncomfortable and I am only 10 weeks....",

Even if that wasn't the case I don't understand why people feel the need to put their two cents in. If you don't believe in getting induced then don't do it. There's no point in putting others down. Especially if you don't know the situation. Thanks expecting6thbaby I hope you have a good pregnancy :)",
