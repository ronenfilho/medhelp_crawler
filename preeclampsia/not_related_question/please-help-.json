            "answer": "They will induce you if your preeclampsia becomes severe enough. I had eclampsia and hellp syndrome with ny fist and was induced at 32 weeks, then I had moderate preeclampsia with my second and was induced at 37 weeks. I have mild preeclampsia now at 31 weeks. If you keep doing well and your preeclampsia doesn't progress you could make it to 41 weeks plus 6 days before you are induced BUT my OB recently told me that new regulations allow induction after 39 weeks with medical need. Preeclamsia qualifies as medical need... if you get upper abdominal pain go in right away because it could be hellp syndrome which can along with preeclamsia and is dangerous. Since you're already 39 weeks and your preeclampsia is mild your baby will be totally fine, just try to relax, drink lots of water, watch your symptoms, keep your doctor informed of changes.",

    "question": "Hello I am a first time mother I'm due in 6 days! The doctor has had me come in every 3 days for 3 weeks! Because they are \"worried\" about me I've had swelling (pre-eclamsia) and everytime I go I get told the same thing and my due date is in 6 days can they force me to carry over 40 weeks? For 3 and a half weeks I have not budged from 1cm dialated my feet stay so swollen they are purple and since 29 weeks my baby has stayed on my siatic nerve I've fallen 4 times what can I do? I'm worried I may fall and hurt her or my pre-elampsia will hurt her ... Or my diabetes and just 6 days to\u00a0\u00a040 weeks",
