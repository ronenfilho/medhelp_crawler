            "answer": "That is a lot of money. I had to change my insurance because I'm having twins and was going to a specialist 3 times a month from the beginning and now I go 8 times a month. Each of my specialist visits were $120 until the beginning of the year. Now they are 35, but my premium went up by $100 a month.\u00a0\u00a0That's aside from my regular delivery Dr. It is insane how much pregnancy can cost.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, NST's on a weekly or bi-weekly basis are totally normal at 35 or 36 weeks and are used to make sure babies are moving alright and handling contractions okay. I wish there was a solution so you didn't have to pay that much.\u00a0\u00a0It is completely unreasonable, and the frustrating part is that they just stick you in a room to sit for 40 minutes and you don't even see the Dr, a nurse just comes in and looks at the monitors every once in a while. Maybe you can talk to them and let them know you can't afford it and see if there is anything you can work out to make it less of a strain on you.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know who could afford $1600 a month, regardless of the fact that it is for your baby.",

            "answer": "I think more then anything its that fact that I am going from no stress test to 2 a week. but they keep telling me everything is normal .. Not to mention if my dr does an ultrasound everytime I got in (after each nst) that $50 per visit the thought of all thay money stresses me out even more. I think I might talk to my dr the day before my test if not they might come back all over the place. I dont make much $2000 a month my hubby makes $500 with all our bill no way csn I afford all these visits",

            "answer": "I didn't always know I was having contractions, but they were showing up on the monitor. Maybe you don't always feel them, even if you think you are? There was one time (I think it was the 6th time I went in) that one of my babies didn't handle a contraction very well (one I didn't even feel). They let me go home but I had to go back the next day for an extra test. Nothing ever came out of it. The same thing had happened to my sister when she was 34+6 and they immediately sent her to the hospital and induced her. I guess every Dr handles it differently. I totally understand your frustration with the amount of tests.\u00a0\u00a0I'm tired of going in so often because it takes so much time out of the day, but I'm glad my babies are okay. Monday I'm considered full term with my twins and every time I go in this week I'll have a little hope that they'll tell me it's just time to deliver my girls. Hopefully they will work something out with you. The nst's are probably necessary, but it is completely unreasonable that you should have to pay that much.",

            "answer": "Im 39 weeks and ny blood pressure has slightly risen with each visit. My last one was 128/90. Theyre worried about preeclampsia and had me do a non stress test last Wednesday and i have another one scheduled this Wednesday. They said everything was fine in my last test so I dont really know why they want me to do another. They also had me do a 24 urine test which i will get the results back Monday. Did they mention preeclampsia with you?",
