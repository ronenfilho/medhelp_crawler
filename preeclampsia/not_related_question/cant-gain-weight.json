            "answer": "Hello,You are in your second trimester and you should start gaining weight. Sometimes a sudden drop in fluid retention can cause weight loss in your second trimester. If you were overweight at the time you conceived, you are not expected to gain as much in your second trimester as a woman who started her pregnancy at a healthy weight. Inadequate weight gain can lead to intrauterine growth retardation. If there is still no weight gain it can be a signal for preeclampsia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension. Other causes can include a lack of amniotic fluid or gestational diabetes. Ensure sufficient intake of proteins and vitamins. It is suggested to get examined by your gynecologist and get evaluated. I hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
