            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Hyperreflexia is defined as overactive or over responsive reflexes i.e. an exaggerated reflex of the muscles. The most common cause of \"hyper-reflexia\" is spinal cord injury. Other causes include Hypernatraemia, Portal hypertension, Preeclampsia, Tetanus, Brain tumor, Stroke, Head trauma.Treatment depends on diagnosing the specific pathology causing this symptom. Should it be caused by illicit or genuine use of medication/stimulants, then it may involve removing these drugs from their healthcare.I think it is lower back pain or strain which is causing all symptoms.Hope this helps.Bye.",
