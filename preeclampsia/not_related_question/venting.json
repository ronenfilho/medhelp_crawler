Now im sitting at home in pain still all bc i stay an hour away from the hospital with no transpertation, my contractions are about 10-13 minutes apart now and lasting about 35-40 seconds along with pressure and it hurts so bad i want to scream, i want to just go to a totally different hospital and see what they say. Im just so frustrated and tired, i want my old dr back bc she did stuff the right way if i had the money i would dang show go to her asap. Im 37 weeks tomorrow and they want me to go to 40 weeks even after the lady dr i seen wrote on my chart 37 1/2 weeks is when i get my csection. I dont know what to do.",
