I just keep an eye out at every appointment because I do know swelling can be because of preeclampisa but it could also be nothing. If ur face starts to swell then that's when to really worry!! Also I drink a lot of water each day. Putting my feet up doesn't really help either but its probably because I never have them up long enough? Lol hope I was somewhat help Lol :)",
