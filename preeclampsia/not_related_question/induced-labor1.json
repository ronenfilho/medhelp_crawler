            "answer": "I just got induced last week so the ordeal is pretty fresh in my memory. I went in on monday at 9am because they wanted to monitor the baby a get a base line on his vitals. They observed me for 2 hrs and did a sonogram to check the baby's position, because he was breeched 2 days before. The baby flipped back into position (head down, face down) so at 11 am they inserted vaginally, cervidil (idk if thats how u spell it). That was very painful for me. Its supposed to soften the cervix for delivery. But they just ram in in there. You have to be laying down for 2hrs before u can move. But the meds take 12hrs to work! So i had to stay there at the hospital. At 11pm they checked my cervix, which was extremely painful cos the meds make it extra sensitive. I had only dilated to 2 after that. A half hr later they started potocin via iv. Which they told me could take up to 12hrs before u are ready to deliver. So u just have to lay there and wait for your contractions or ur water to break. I have preeclampsia so my bp was thru the roof and had to have emergency meds during this, at 4am which stalled my labor. They finally stabilized me and gave me an epidural. There's more to my ordeal but I'll leave that out. Finaly about 1pm on Tuesday they tell me im ready to push. My little man finally came at 1:24pm. Sorry so long. But no one told me what to expect til mins before it was gonna happen...",

            "answer": "I was enduced with both my previous pregnancies and my first was painful but I blame it on me being out of shape and didn't keep a healthy diet so I was very weak. On my 2nd I kept a healthy diet and exercise I gained only a 17 lbs, I got enduced also but it was very easy not painful at all. So I definitely think it's different every time.",
