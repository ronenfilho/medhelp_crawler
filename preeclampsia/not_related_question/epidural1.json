I was nervous of the epidural also, but it was the best thing ever. I didn't even feel it go in except for a bit of pressure and didn't feel it at all when my nurse took the needle out.",

            "answer": "If your hospital allows, try laboring in a warm bath. Believe it or not the pain is much more bearable. Also try rocking or a sitting position while having a contraction. It wasn't until my third baby that tried those methods. Contractions were way easier to deal with. I unfortunately ended up with an epidural after my labor stopped progressing and had to use pitocin. But up til then labor wasnt too bad.",

I highly recommend you research birthing techniques.\u00a0\u00a0I prefer hypnobirthing.Also, check with your hospital to see what their requirements are for labor. Most require you to be strapped to monitors and an IV\u00a0\u00a0from the moment you are checked in. This is the worst way to labor. Some are figuring this out and are more \"natural\u00a0\u00a0friendly\".\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you labor at home for a while. You can take a warm bath, walk around, use around birthing ball, change positions and then go to the hospital when labor is progressing further along. Make sure you have a birth team that is supportive in your wishes. Talk to your doctor or midwife along the way, during your appointments, so they know your wishes. Talk about your options. Put together a birth plan.",

            "answer": "I too was creeped out at the thought of a needle in my back and truly wanted to go nautrul. However due to developong preeclampsia with dangerously high blood pressures I ended up needing an emergency c-section and therefore an epidural was a necessity. I will admit that next to the contractions that were very strong because of pitocin (given during my failed induction), the epidural wasn't painful and worked great. I will pray you are able to have a smooth and easy deliver with no need for the epidural at all but should it become necessary don't worry it will be okay in the end as long as baby and you are healthy through it all!! :) :)",

            "answer": "I labored for 41 hours. Things progressed so fast after I got my epidural. The last 6 hours of my labor were amazing due to the epidural. I was 4cm at 4pm when I got it. Was 6cm at 6pm, water broke, was fully dilated & ready to push by 8:30pm, baby was born at 10:55pm.I'm not trying to push the epidural because everyone should do what is best for them. I'm just sayin it's not as bad or delaying as some people think. My labor was very hard for many many hours which is not what or how we expected our birth to go. I couldn't walk through my contractions. Anyway, do what's best for you, but keep your options open because you just don't know how you'll labor.Good luck & best wishes for a happy, healthy delivery.",
