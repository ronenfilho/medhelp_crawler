We also have a nice supply of diapers , wipes, formula and clothes. We started buying items around 12 weeks. Even though I'm due in Jan she will be here in 7-8 weeks if not sooner due to me developing preeclampsia and gestational diabeties. You never know what could happen or when your baby will decide to arrive so it's always better to be prepared!",

Some items have to be ordered and cantake a couple of weeks. And you never know if the little one will surprise you with an early arrival. Besides those big items, I would say just make sure you have the essentials once you hit the 30's.",

I'm starting to focus more on the nursery: paint, decorations, furniture. That's my husband's and mine responsibility so that's where we will focus our money and energy.",
