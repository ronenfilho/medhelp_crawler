            "answer": "Thanks :)But question: did you have a family history of Pre eclampsia or something? because that kind of scares me, i did read a study saying 20% preemie women will get complications during or after pregnancy.Im soooo terrified i hate not knowing my outcome..i don't want to die during or after pregnancy. hope i don't get pre eclampsia or any complication, i will be stressed the whole pregnancy for sure. I was having break downs three years ago because i convinced myself i would die during wisdom teeth surgery because i had to be knocked out with general anesthesia, inconvinced myself i was not waking up.I am seeing a therapist to see if i can get over extreme fear of pregnancy but i dunno...i know for sure i will need a MRI with contrast before i consider pregnancy..so doctor better give me one at least that will ease my mind alittle knowing i don't have brain malformations due to being born a microbaby in 80's.ugh i feel sooo stressed and can't feel happy about the future ..hate it",

I worry i may have AVM or something i don't know about. I do have ringing in ears..mainly when its quite and sometimes a whoosing but my doctor thinks its nothing neurological.Can i ask for a MRI with contrast before pregnancy and antiphospholipid bloodwork to be sure no blood disorders before i try and concieve? i live in ontario, canadaIf i rule out AVM or any other brain disorder, blood issues and my cholesterol and blood pressure stays fine through pregnancy and i got no other disease.\u00a0\u00a0should i not have a stroke?doctors think My mom had a mini stroke at age 45, my grandmother on my moms side had diabetes and two heart attacks..last one killed her.
