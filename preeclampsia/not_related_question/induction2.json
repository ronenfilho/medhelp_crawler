            "answer": "This is my 3rd pregnancy and I've been induced both other times due to going past due date. In a way its nice because you know its coming and you arent stuck in a situation racing to the hospital. It isnt bad. They will just hook you up to baby minister and Iv. You will probably be given pitocin which is what kick starts labor. It can take anywhere from a couple of hours to a day or so just depends on how you and baby respond. Only big downside is if your body does not respond properly and you just dont go into labor, they may either decide to send you home and reschedule or if they are worried about preeclampsia they may decide to do a csection. But usually pitocin works and you go into labor. Good luck! You may wind up with a christmas baby :)",
