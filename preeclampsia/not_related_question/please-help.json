            "answer": "The thyroglobulin antibody test was way out of range, which indicates that you do in fact have hashimoto's. Your TSH is what doctors look at, and since that looked good, they probably assume you're fine. Problem is doctors need to test for Free T3 and Free T4 since those are actual thyroid hormones. TSH is a pituitary hormone. It is mostly used as a screener for thyroid issues, but because the pituitary is a completely different gland, it might take years, or might not even ever go out of range despite being hypothyroid. You need to request that these tests be performed, or find a doctor that will. I'm actually surprised that they tested for antibodies, since usually that is done as a way to confirm the cause.Anyway, not only can hashimoto's\u00a0\u00a0cause miscarriages, but it can cause anxiety and panic attacks! So your excessive worrying could simply be a symptom, not a personality disorder. I suggest getting tested for Free T3 and Free\u00a0\u00a0T4. FT4 should be in the middle of the range, while FT3 should be in the upper third. You'll hafta tweak dosages and such to find what works for you. And only AFTER your symptoms go away, and your in range, should you start trying again to have children. Many things can happen during pregnancy without proper thyroid hormones. Instead of miscarrying, your child could be born mentally and physically disabled. You can also be at risk for preeclampsia, which isn't fun either. It puts you and your infant at risk. I went through that. I was very lucky.",

            "answer": "Antibody tests that are positive could be slightly out of range, in the hundreds, and even thousands. My TPO was 475 with the range being 0-34, yet my TGab was fine. Some people with hashi's have either TPO out of range, TGab out of range, and some times even both.TSH .522 with a range of .450-4.55 is very good, if that's all you're looking at. Many people being treated for hashi's keep theirs borderline low to 1. I am being treated, and while my TSH was last tested at .52 and .45, I do not feel any better as far as symptoms go. Prior to diagnosis, my TSH was always within range, until pregnancy bounced it to 13.34Anxiety and panic attacks are usually known more for being HYPERthyroid symptoms instead of HYPOthyroid, but many still experience hyper symptoms anyway. A lot of hypO people also suffer from brain fog, and there are a lot of various cognitive issues that arise from it, and of course they differ from person to person as well as their intensity. I know that before treatment I was extremely paranoid about everything. My husband claimed I had a few panic attacks. I'm still not sure if I had them or not, as I wiki'ed what one was, and I don't think they were ever that severe.You can have your regular doctor treat you if he/she feels comfortable doing it. Mine was who first diagnosed me, so he was the one who prescribed meds for it. He said that he was comfortable treating me, but would refer me to an endo if I wanted one. I went that route, saw two different endos, but all they did was treat TSH. So now that is as low as it can be while staying within range, I still feel the same. I went back to my regular doctor, because they would test FT3 and FT4 if I asked for it, while the others wouldn't. I have an appointment this Friday where I will get to finally see the results for the tests my two endos wouldn't do. If he's willing to treat me beyond TSH, then I will continue with him, otherwise my search continues.This seems to be the way with so many people here. You may want to still seek an endo because they are technically specialist, but also since you're trying to have a child. Both the thyroid and reproductive system involve endocrinology. But make sure they're willing to test for FT3 and FT4 every time. Go to a primary doctor if you don't want to wait, from there, they can start initial treatment, and then refer you if you want an endo later.",
