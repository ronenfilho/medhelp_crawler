            "answer": "yes you're getting pains ten.times stronger then a natural birth. LOOK i wont talk you out of it so I will explain the induction cycle. which is pitocin, epidural and c section. why okay when a woman goes into labor she naturally releases oxytocin and that starts her labor contractions etc its natural. Pitocin is a drug that forces ur labor and releases oxytocin but those contractions are a 100 times worse then a natural labor. From pitocin the pain gets so bad your going to want and epidural. Once you get the epidural it will slow down contractions and sometimes it stops completely so there u go getting another dose of pitocin. This can cause your baby to become distressed or if your body does not comply to the pitocin you might not dialate or stop dialating. That is when they give u a c section to save your child life after they endangered it to begin with because its not natural. Many woman whove been induced go through this cycle or have been right on the verge. So i'm going to give u great tips if u still decide to get induced so you dont end up with a c section. 1. get the epidural when ur at a five or six in dilation or not at all. 2. every time you feel a contraction or almost every time ur going to push light pushes lil by lil ok ( this helps you guide ur baby and together you to start to help u dialate faster) 3. mind over matter dont focus on the pain levels. 4. if you get induced avoid at all cost the drug misoprostol (cytotec). It is not fda approved it can kill u and ur baby and its category x no pregnant women should take it. Even with that said many hospitals still administer it to pregnant woman. thet will tell u it helps thin out ur cervix but it is not safe. 5. remember to breathe and goodluck.tips to naturally induce labor is to have sex and you can Google natural ways to release oxytocin. which can help you ok goodluck",

            "answer": "I agree with the first comment. My water broke but I wasn't dilating fast enough so they gave me pitocin. My epidural didn't work the pain was horrible and I didn't get past an 8 my doctor wasn't listening to me when I said I wasn't ready to push but they made me anyways and I ended up have a c section. But good luck mamma these are just some things to think about",
