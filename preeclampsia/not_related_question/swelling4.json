            "answer": "at 29weeks my doc said I have a mild preeclampsia , my bp got higher at 130/90 .and I felt bad about that but my OB said that I just need to have a bedrest , and she gave me a medicine to lower my BP its a good news that after a week my bp went to normal again . Im 36weeks now but I still have a swelling in my feet and hands but not that bad , because they say that it is normal to have swelling if your near in your due date . and when the swellings Gone it means your in a labor very soon , Just always walk every morning it is very a good exercise . Goodluck :)))))))))))",
