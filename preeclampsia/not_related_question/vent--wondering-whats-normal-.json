But now they go numb when I sleep on both sides, so I'm constantly try to get comfy. My Dr said it nerves being compressed by my uterus. There is a name for this condition, and it usually goes away after pregnancy, but can linger... hope that helps I totally feel your pains.",

(Sorry these are the questions they ask me here in the hospital since being admitted when I mention pain). Does it appear you have any swelling? Especially in your face? I'd contact your ob ti let them know, you could be dealing with preeclampsia, which is best detected early, left untreated it can turn into eclampsia which causes seizures and other serious symptoms.
