My daughter\u00a0\u00a0was sick last week with 104.9 fever and he gave me a very hard\u00a0\u00a0time about\u00a0\u00a0going to ER. He was afraid of cost. Come to find out\u00a0\u00a0she had viral meningitis and was severely\u00a0\u00a0dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Had to have iv and spinal tap. He felt pretty bad and immediately\u00a0\u00a0changed his tune afterward. Hes still a little insensitive\u00a0\u00a0to my aches and pains, but gradually\u00a0\u00a0coming around. Just remember, there\u00a0\u00a0is no way they could ever handle what a woman handles being\u00a0\u00a0pregnant and delivering a baby.",

            "answer": "That's abuse. I'd leave him. You'd be better off if you were able to make decisions, since his decisions are based on idiocy and a power trip. He's treating you AND the kids badly. No of you deserve it or have to stay in the situation that he's created.Those are symptoms of preeclampsia. Go to the hospital.",

            "answer": "Go to the hospital. Download a game or something on your phone for your kid. Then seriously, don't call to tell him what's going on. When you get home, if he asks what they said, ignore him. Will it help the situation? Probably not. But if he can be an ***, why can't you?Thankfully I don't have that issue exactly. Instead I have the issue of my bf just started a new job and won't get paid for a couple of weeks. He damn sure came up with the money for his truck payment, but won't have all the money for rent until past the due date, and yet still asked to borrow $40 from my son's piggy bank so he could buy weed. -_-And anytime I have something weird going on that's pregnancy related, he yells at me and tells me I'm killing his kid. For instance, last week something was going on with my kidneys I guess bc a couple of times I pissed there was blood in it. Well he actually witnessed it one day, and that's instantly what he started yelling at me. Saying I did something by picking stuff up. You know what I picked up? The gift bags to take the party bc it was oldests birthday...",
