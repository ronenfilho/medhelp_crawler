            "answer": "I never had that, but being a nurse, I'm sure you know that is considered excessive edema. Granted the 12 hour shift had a great deal to do with it, but I would definitely let your doctor know in the morning. How is your blood pressure? I guess you also know all the signs of preeclampsia. Hey, why don't you take a picture of your legs and show it to your doc! Lol.....pictures don't lie.",
