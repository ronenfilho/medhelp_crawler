            "answer": "A normal bp is 120/80. Please keep a close watch on your bp. The swelling your having and elevated bp could get out of hand and become preeclampsia. Watch your salt intake and continue to monitor your bp. Your dr is probably making you aware of it before it becomes a problem.As for the arm numbness if it's in your wrists it's probably carpal tunnel. You can get wrist splints at the drug store or at an orthopedic drs office. That's pretty much all you can do at this point. Hopefully it subsides after pregnancy.Hope you get to feeling better soon!Ginger",
