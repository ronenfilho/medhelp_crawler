            "answer": "I can relate. I'm due March 1st and the past week and a half have been terrible with my emotions. I feel so anxious and depressed sometimes that I can't function. And my hope of having the baby early is dwindling. It seems like I'll be like this forever now. And last night I had weird dreams about labor. One was that I woke up with a girl instead of a boy - a bit problematic for all the blue clothes we have. And that I kept falling over and almost hitting her head. And the worst part was that I couldn't remember anything about the labor- not even having contractions. And then I had another dream that I was at Office Depot and the umbilical cord started to come out, and the ambulance people had to do an emergency C-section on me. But the last thing they said was that they messed up my anesthetic and I would feel it. But all's I wanted was for Sean to be safe.All I can say is hang in there. You aren't the only one.",

            "answer": "I am only 12 weeks and was complaining of headaches to my friend yesterday. She told me that she never had much trouble with headaches until she was aroung 37 weeks. When she went in for her weekly appt., they checked her blood pressure and it was through the roof. They told her that her severe headaches, dizziness, and high blood pressure were due to preeclampsia setting in and she delivered that day. Not to scare either of you...but if your weekly checkup isn't tomorrow (Mon), you may want to call your doc to have things checked! Maybe it's nothing...but you never know! Good luck to both of you! :)",
