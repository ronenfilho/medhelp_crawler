I was pregnant a year later and carried to 35 weeks I had preeclampsia and had to be induced. He was born 4lbs 12ozs and was healthy. I think I was to stressed out while pregnant with him. So try your best not to stress. It may help you to buy a sonoline b heart Doppler. It will help ease worry. Good luck God bless and Congratulations.",

I had a lot of anxiety about miscarriage in the beginning & I talked to my OB.about it. He has done an ulyra.sound at every appointment and told me that if I have any concerns at all to call and he's more than willing to have me come in to check out me and the baby.Have you thought about buying one of those machines that let you listen to the baby's heartbeat? I haven't bought one, but they're about $20 and my OB told me if I buy one, he wants me to bring it in so he can be sure I'm putting.I'm the right place.I wish you all the best!",
