            "answer": "If you go over your due date by too far that could be a reasonable cause for induction. After about 40 weeks the placebta doesn't work as efficiently and can start to die off, causing lack of nutrients and oxygen to the baby, ultimately putting baby at risk. Since due dates are estimated most drs let you go about 2 weeks past before inducing for this reason. Other reasons for induction may be fetal distress or preeclampsia. Just remember you have the right as a patient to ask questions and have a thorough understanding of any procedure or intervention offered to you. They cannot force you to do anything you don't want to.",

Turns out doctor is about to leave on a two week vacation and didn't want to pay anyone else to \"catch\" his babies. It's just one example. Like I said. These doctors are not the norm, but they are out there.Do what you anyone really comfortable with. In a healthy pregnancy, it is better just to let baby come on its own.",

Pitocin stresses the baby out because your contractions are closer and stronger so thats no brake for you or baby thats why the babies heart rate sometimes drops when induced. You can go 42 weeks.
