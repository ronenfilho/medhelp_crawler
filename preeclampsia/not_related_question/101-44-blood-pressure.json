            "answer": "It's amazing that pregnancy books talk about hypertension and preeclampsia, but don't talk about low blood pressure (normal is 120/80).\u00a0\u00a0Your diastolic number (the lower number) is quite scary.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have your thyroid checked, a septicimia test, and a test to see if you've developed gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If those check out okay, you need to drink more fluids, take iron, B-12 and folate supplements along with a better nutrition overall.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, my iron levels were very low causing low blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking iron supplements for the last 6 or so weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My energy came back within a few days of starting the supplement.",

            "answer": "Low blood pressure is actually very common while pregnant for half a variety of reasons. What is your normal? There are a few ways to remedy it if you can't immediately get in. You need to drink LOTS of water, and elevate your feet. This can be done by laying on the floor with your feet up, pillows on a couch, bed, etc etc. Its also important to speak to your doctor about. It's not life or death, but is important to discuss. If it bottoms out you risk syncope and just feeling miserable and being pregnant its possible harm could be done to the baby if you fainted. If it doesn't get better, DO NOT drive or move too much. Call family or EMS personal.",

            "answer": "Thank you everyone. I ended up drinking water, propping my legs up and I right to sleep. I just woke up checked it and its back to my semi normal which is 123/71.\u00a0\u00a0I just put a call into the doctor so they should be calling me back soon. This really worries me bc I've been battling high blood pressure numbers\u00a0\u00a0like 144/89 and so on. Just got off the phone with the doctor she said drink lots and lots of water (like we already haven't heard that a million times since we've seen the plus sign on the pregnancy test : P ) and stay cool. being over heated can cause low blood pressure also along with laying on your back. I truly haven't been good on my\u00a0\u00a0 water intake the last few days and I have been pretty over\u00a0\u00a0heated so I am taking the blame on this! Gah\u00a0\u00a0lol she said to keep an eye on it and if it happens again to call and they'll have me come in or go into triage.",
