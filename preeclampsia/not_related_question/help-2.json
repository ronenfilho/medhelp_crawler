            "answer": "They really should be in as long as possible. 37 weeks was full term, the board of pediatrics moved it back to 39 weeks. They have better apgar scores along with nursing reflexes the longer they stay in. Im past 40 weeks now and am willing to wait until 41 1/2 if thats what he needs. I know its uncomfortable but not that much longer :) you can do it. My doc didnt check for dilation until 37 and she said even that was early unless you're showing signs of labor.",

            "answer": "We would have no way of knowing if you're dilated mama.\u00a0\u00a0And it's really too early to have your baby. The doc wouldn't even talk about it before 39 weeks (only sooner if you had a medical emergency that required it). Your baby still needs their lungs and other organs to develop more to function properly when they are born. You want that baby in there as long as possible. Hang in there. The end is tough on all of us.",
