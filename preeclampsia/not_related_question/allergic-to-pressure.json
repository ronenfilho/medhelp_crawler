            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it is possible that you have pressure urticaria. This can develop within minutes or within 4-6 hours. Any pressure, scratch etc results in hives. Keep your skin well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids, eat citrus fruits, use a good moisturizer and avoid scratching. If you feel the need to scratch, then use your finger pads to rub the area instead of the normal scratch. The treatment is to avoid pressure, which is actually not possible. Treatment is by antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, Cyclosporine, steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. Any one of these medications can be tried under the treatment of a dermatologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I developed preeclampsia during my most recent pregnancy, my baby was born 1/24/12.\u00a0\u00a0In the early weeks following her birth I could not stand for very long before my feet and ankles would start to itch, sometimes up into my calves and knees-I assumed it was related to that. It was a burning itching sensation, similar to the feeling of a blood pressure cuff squeezing way too tight.\u00a0\u00a0It went away for awhile, but has come back again.\u00a0\u00a0I find myself marching in place while I change diapers or do dishes because the feeling is excruciating.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone know what is wrong and how I can get relief?",

    "question": "When my body has physical pressure put on it, minutes to hours later, I will swell up in those spots.\u00a0\u00a0It can last for days sometimes, and if it's really bad, I will feel very tired, achy and nauseous.\u00a0\u00a0For example:\u00a0\u00a0my shirt bunches up in my sleep and I will have welts on my torso. My shoe laces are too tight and the tops of my feet will swell.\u00a0\u00a0I ride a bike and my butt will swell. etc, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It has happened everywhere, even on my head.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for food allergies and dermographia and was negative.\u00a0\u00a0Is this really an allergy to pressure and can it be fixed?",
