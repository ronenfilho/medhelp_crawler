            "answer": "Well if they do induce at least your far enough along that little one shouldn't have any complications at all. And gestational diabetes along with your high bp should go away right after delivery. I have high bp too and I'm in the beginning stages of preeclampsia. I'm only 33 weeks. And if I get preeclampsia all the way I'll be hospitalized on full bed rest until I can safely deliver at 37 weeks. Stay strong mama. All will be well! Your body is going through enough, and stressing will only raise your bp lol ;)",
