            "answer": "I've been on maternity leave since my 29th week I'm 32 weeks tomorrow and I'm due January 8th. I was taken out by my doctor because of developing preeclampsia. I have to take it easy which is hard because I enjoy cooking and cleaning. But I have found small things to do like organize a photo album we have been Talking about for a couple years lol. But I am so bored until my husband gets home. Thankful I have an amazing hubby who is always home right after 4 since he is a teacher. he cooks, cleans and does whatever I ask. Of course before this happened he was always right beside me helping! I'm happy my doctor is not going to have me go to my due date. We are delivering my 37th week so only 5 more weeks of boredom!!",
