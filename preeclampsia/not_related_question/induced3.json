            "answer": "I fully agree that babies should come when they're ready; some doctors will schedule inductions for a time that is convenient to them. Some mothers will do the same thing. However, for some of us, it's a matter of being induced or risking our child's life. With my first I had an aging placenta; I live at high altitude and the lack of oxygen can become a problem. I went 9 days past my due date that time. This pregnancy I am having problems with my blood pressure and it is quickly becoming preeclampsia. So I am getting induced tomorrow morning. I really wanted to go into labor naturally but I don't want to risk my baby. I trust my doctor so I agreed to the induction, though it is killing me (figuratively).Induction rates are very high, but sometimes it is the right choice. Infant mortality rates might be higher (they would for me) if doctors never induced.",
