I was already having contractions though. but it was the day after my baby was due, so they swept me, and then just started to induce me. when your body is ready, it's ready. after going through what I went through with the delivery of my daughter, and 3 miscarriages (one being 17wks and birthing him with no drugs just in September), I'd totally have wished I did things differently.I know it's hard to relax cause you want to meet your baby. but it's well worth it.",
