            "answer": "I noticed nobody has answered yet. I don't think i can be of much help because i always have low blood pressure. But i thought high blood pressure was caused more by stress rather than doing to much and if it causes you to stress doing nothing, then it might be better to keep busy and try to take more breaks to relax. I hope that helps. Good luck.",

    "question": "K well i asked some friends an i guess they didnt think it was very important so ill ask you guys. My dr has finally noticed my high blood pressure. Im 37 weeks and everytime i go in its high! Im concerned this is my 3rd baby an i just want another healthy baby never had this before. He told me to kinda stay off my feet an get some help around the house. :/ well thats impossible i have no family (parents dead, inlaws work, sister lives no where near me and im in the middle of no where with no neighbors) im usually a hard worker manual labor does not bother me, but sitting around being lazy kinda does.Ok sorry so my question is has anyone else had high blood pressure and how concerned should i be about it ?Also i recently got diarrhea for no apparent reason.. i eat normal, except lately its hard for me to eat anything cause everything gives me heartburn and makes me sick.Hoping someone can tell me somthing bout it. Like warning signs or something",
