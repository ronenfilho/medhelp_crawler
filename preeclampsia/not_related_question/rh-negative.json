            "answer": "Hi,I too am RH neg and developed antibodies after my first pregnancy. I also didn't get the Rhogam shot, I have had several miscarriages since then which are blamed on other hormones but I think the my antibodies do have something to do with it. One thing to note is that bleeding in pregnancy is quite common and sometimes not a problem, always best to check with a dr though. I bled on and off with my son and he was fine, problems developed later in the pregnancy but it had nothing to do with the bleeding. Pregnant women who haven't had the Rhogam shot usually get an injection to suppress the antibodies around 16 weeks, and sometimes again at around 7/8 months, insist on getting the Rhogam 2 days after delivery at the latest, don't let them talk you out of it for whatever reason, it's much easier the next time around once you've had it.Hope that helps!Have a happy and healthy 9 months!",

            "answer": "Well, both my boys ended up with rh negative blood so I didn't need the shot after I had them. It just seems weird that I have created antibodies since I had my youngest (2 1/2 years ago). I didn't have them then and the antibodies aren't very potent. My ob said that when diluted just once they were no longer present. So... lets just hope they stay that way. I just got my rhogam for this pregnancy because I have been bleeding (although its been 14 days so not sure if that will make a difference ... not being in the first 72 hours and all). Like I said I just hope that it doesn't end up causing MORE problems with this one. I mean I have already had 4 ultrasounds and have been to the doctor more than I would like. I am about to start taking insulin for my diabetes and they want to do a 24 hour urine to keep tabs on my high blood pressure and make sure I do not get preeclampsia. Ugh. I know this HAS to be a girl. And I guarantee with this much trouble now she will be an ANGEL when she's born :) lol",

    "question": "So I am rh negative and I found out I have some antibodies (anitbodies jk). I have a feeling that my body made them after my last miscarriage in October (they did not give me my rhogam shot). I am now 8weeks 5days and I have already had a lot of stress with this pregnancy. Including bleeding for 2weeks today. I just want to know if there any mommies out there who have rh negative blood type and have had antibodies. I know that this can create rh disease for the baby and create problems (I do not need anymore). What did your doctor do and how did/is your pregnancy go/ing?",
