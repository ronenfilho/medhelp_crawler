            "answer": "With my DD I didnt have to be induced and had a epidural that worked wonderfully.\u00a0\u00a0However with my DS it was a different story. My water had broke yet I was contracting like I should of been so they started me on pitocin. By 4cm I got an epidural. However they did not turn the pitocin down like they were supposed to. Which ended up with me having two contractions, one on top of another, without giving the baby a rest inbetween. Was to hard on him and his heart rate dropped bad enough where I had to be put on Oxygen. After that anytime we tried to push, his heart rate would drop again. It was a long scary process. Everything eventually worked out and he was a healthy baby boy for 2 yrs. :)Will I ever get pitocin again? Not a chance.\u00a0\u00a0But please keep in mind everyones pregnancy/ body is different. I had friends that were induced and everything went GREAT!!! :)",

I keep having a battle with myself whether I gave my body enough time to do it on my own. But I have not have any progress in three weeks. I am only 1/2 cm and 50% effaced. I really hope the induction works and I dont have a c-section. I am really healthy and so is my baby. I have worked out my whole pregnancy so I'm hoping that will help somehow. But I am still really nervous. Any words of encouragement will be appreciated. I go in today to get the foley catherdar placed. Hopefully that will start something. I dont have ANY contractions or pain, whatsoever. Just didnt think this was the way in would all go down. But I am so overdue and with NO signs so it probably is best.",

I had to call the hospital july4th to see what time they wanted me to come in so I did and they asked me to come in right away. My induction started off at 8:30 I was already 70-80% effaced from the jell and only half a centimeter dilated. They quickly turned up the pitocin in about a 3-4 hour timespan and my contractions were about 2-3 mins apart. They attempted to break my water when I was a centimeter dilated but that didn't work. They came back around 2 and broke my water. The contractions hurt but they weren't bad at all. I dilated to 3 cm then 4 theb 5 cm by 8 that night and I was tired because I got little sleep the night before and they didn't think I would have him until about 8 the next morning so they wanted me to get sleep but I wasn't able to sleep though the contractions since like 2 that afternoon so they gave me the option of getting the epidural( which I didn't want or need) now or get it later before a c section because they thought I would be to exhausted to push him out and I didn't want a c section so I got the epidural it didn't work so they had the guy come and give me another dose and like an hour later I was feeling pain in my back on the left side so I didn't tell them till 11 though so he came back and gave me another dose and then my night nurse checked me at 12:30\u00a0\u00a0and told me I was complete and he the baby was already at the perineum. I pushed for 25 minutes and out came my little boy at 1:06am July 5th weighing 9lbs 7 oz 21 inches long. I loved it he only part that I hated was the epidural",

He tried 3 times and said if he didn't get it on the 4th try I wouldn't be able to have it. During my 1st pregnancy the dr got it on the first try! Anyway, neither of my labors were that long. The first time the nurse said it would be at least another hour... about 10 minutes later our DD was born. And just about the same thing with the induced one. I mean the our DR just made it to the room during both births. The second birth seemed easier than the first so I figure this time around #3 will be even easier. Another funny thing is that both our DD's were born at 11:59am and 11:57am. I had went to the hospital at around midnight for our 1st baby and arrived at the hospital for induction at 6am the 2nd time. Maybe this one will be born 11:55am...Also I was only 2 days past my due date, but our DD was 8lb 6oz. Oh, and our 1st was born right on her due date.",

Ironically i had saw my doctor and he said it wasnt amniotic fluid its all his fault that i had to get it induced. If he had realized that it was indeed amniotic fluid i probably would have been spared hours of pitocin. Either way, i ended up going to hospital and they began inducing my labor. I had pitocin with no epidural. As you can imagine it was painful. I was extremely tired, but i had opted against the epidural because i hate needles. So i was in labor for about 18 long hours. Gave birth to a 6.6lb baby girl and they continued the pitocin after the labor which was very uncomfotable. It causes contractions. Yes even after birth. they do this to prevent hemorrhaging i believe.",
