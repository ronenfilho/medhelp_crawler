My symptoms were hands, face and feet swelled up huge and didn't go down with rest, extreme pain in right side just below rib, blinded by white spots, bp extremely high (170/140 with first, 160/90 with this one) over two readings at least a couple of hours apart, and protein in urine. Black spots or 'floaters' are usually a sign of low blood pressure. Had you been standing in the shower for a while? If your worries mention it to your dr and ask him to check your blood pressure.

            "answer": "@mom_520 I get preeclamplsia in my pregnancies because I don't grow very good placentas. My babies can't get enough oxygen and nutrients which puts the placenta under a lot of pressure to work harder, which put stress on my liver, which leaks enzymes to my kidneys which leaks proteins giving the side effects of swelling, high blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0headaches, white spotsnin vision. Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0there's not a lot they can do to prevent it or stop it until they remove the baby and the placenta but they can manage the symptoms with a aspirin and calcium to help the blood flow through the placenta, and blood pressure meds to keep the spots, swelling and high bp under control. Once the protein gets too much its a good indication the liver and kidneys are struggling so they tend to deliver, my son was born at 35wks, or your body decides for itself that its had enough and you can into preterm labour as what happened to me this time at 27wks (but they were able to stop it!). There is a lot they can do and it really dependa on how early in your pregnancy you developed it. Fingers crossed you don't have it and wishing you a smooth pregnancy!",
