            "answer": "I feel like I am reading my own story. I too found out I have a bicornuate uterus when I first got pregnant back in March. I've had multiple ultrasounds previously but it was never noticed. As far as my doctor tells me, it is hard to detect and some women won't know until a doctor is performing surgery or a c-section for a breech baby. I too lost a baby at 19 weeks that had an severe giant omphalocele ( this is so bizarre that both of us have both unrelated things - and that one has no bearing on the other). I am again pregnant (like you) but am 14 weeks along with the baby\u00a0\u00a0up in the right horn. My doctor is considering me high risk but also says that many women with a bicornuate uterus deliver happy healthy babies, we just have a higher rate of early delivery and/or the need for a c-section due to the baby being breech. As far as where the baby is implanted, as long as it is not on the septum, things are generally good (it wouldn't get enough nutrients to support growth). And as far as carrying, only time can tell how big your \"half\" of a uterus where the baby is will stretch before it says, time to have this baby. I'm still in shock to\u00a0\u00a0be reading your post. Please keep in touch and let me know how things go and how your doctor handles your situation. But we do have good chances of carrying healthy babies.Shelley",

            "answer": "Hey i'ts disheartening to find out you have a bicornate uterus. Mine was detected quite a few years ago after 2 micariages. Ihad a test called hysterosalphingogram or hsg for short. they run a radiopaque dye into your reproductive system. When I was pregnant with my son, i lost him at 19 weeks. Don't know why, there's was nothing wrong with him. any way i went to the complications clinic at UAB and they told my he was implanted midline, not in a horn. they said that was good. but i still lost. I'ts been very hard to deal with this. i alos have ahd a hard time getting pregnant. ususally taking at least one year to concieve, however this time i haveonly had 2 periods since my last miscarriage in aug. now I'm 5 weeks and praying that God will bring this child forth in spite of my uterus. I'm sorry you having to deal with this. most stories you read on the internet are not good. i stopped reading them. like shelley said though, there are many many women who go on to have healthy babies.

That is when there are 2 separate uteri and sometimes to separate cervix.\u00a0\u00a0In most of the cases, a septus separates the vagina into 2 parts.\u00a0\u00a0I guess this one is pretty easy to diagnose if the septum in the vagina is present.\u00a0\u00a0If you want more info here's a good site:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.dyspareunia.org/html/uterine_abnormality.htmHope this helps!Eboni L.",

    "question": "I am 6 weeks pregnant and just found out I have a bicornuate uterus. This has been confirmed by 2 different physicians after 2 different ultrasounds, one being a level 2 ultrasound. What they didn't tell me is how severe the split of my uterus is. Is there anyway to diagnose whether the split is partial or complete via ultrasound, maybe 3D? Will my chances of having a live birth be lowered if it is a complete split? What I find particularly odd is that I was pregnant before and had several ultrasounds where nobody noticed this. I had to terminate that pregnancy at 14 weeks due to multiple anomilies (omphalocele, neural tube defects, others). I was told that the baby had no chance of survival. How could they miss the fact that my uterus is bicornuate? One last question: does it matter where the fetus plants itself in a bicornuate uterus? Mine is in the right horn, but they did not say how far up.\u00a0\u00a0 I have done tons of reading on this subject but have not found answers to these questions.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for you help.
