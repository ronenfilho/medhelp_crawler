Advocate for what you believe in and you may be surprised at how strong you are. I can relate to not feeling heard, it's a hard time to go through. In a few months all of this will be far behind you so just stay strong to what you believe in and focus on the health and love between you and your baby.",

When your water brwaks early it can cause infections for both of you if not taken care of carefully.\u00a0\u00a0As whybthey might have you in a hospital on bed rest versus being at home on bed rest. Just take it easy ask how baby is doing and how high of a heart rate the baby has every day. As long as it stays high don't worry your doing wonderful for your baby. Its safe after 34 weeks to have baby. Baby may have to stay longer in hospital for monitoring but its for babys safety. If ever you have questions ask them there is no stupid question\u00a0\u00a0when it comes to pregnancy worries. Good luck and rest up.",
