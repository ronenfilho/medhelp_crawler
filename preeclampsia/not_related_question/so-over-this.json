            "answer": "I'll be 37 weeks on thursday, and I feel your pain. I've been so miserable and uncomfortable. I've been having contractions since I was about 20 weeks, and it is seriously making me crazy. I'm sick of being in pain, I'm tired of not being able to move around, and I simply need a beer. Lol. The only time I ever really really want a drink is when I'm pregnant tho. I'm being induced at 39 weeks because I have very fast deliveries and live at LEAST 45 mins from the hospital. But with traffic it can be about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. About 16 days left!",

    "question": "Tomorrow I'll be 37weeks and I am 100% done already. Had my bloody show and have been experiencing false labor for the past few days.. Doctor's think I won't progress into actual labor until my son gets into position and starts engaging!! His lack of movement has resulted in an emergency scan being booked for tomorrow as its very unusual for bubs to be quiet the whole day\u00a0\u00a0and as he's a multiple offender for reduced movement they're going to replan my whole delivery plan :c I'm so ready to meet my little munchkin",
