            "answer": "I have gestational hypertension so I know what your going through. We put our home up for sale and went under contract to sell it the day we found out we were expecting so we packed and moved to an apartment for 3 months while our new home was being built. That home fell through and we put a new offer on a different home that same week so stress was high! We ended up buying the second home and moving in the week before my third trimester. My BP started to spike during that time and around my 28th week appointment it was super high I was sent to L&D with the possibility of taking our baby early thankfully it went down and I was sent home the same day. The next week the called me into the office since I had also developed Gestational Diabetes and my BP was high at that visit so I was sent back to the hospital for monitoring over night and a 24hour urine test to check for preeclampsia my level for that was 200 preeclampsia level is 300. So my doctor put me on maternity leave at 29 weeks on light bed rest so we could keep our baby in longer. I have been to a high risk doctor weekly since to monitor our baby and since I have a couple issue I'm being induced at 37 weeks exactly. Which is two weeks from today.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken multiple test for preeclampsia since then thankfully it has stayed at bay. But I have been told i am a ticking time bomb that could happen anytime. Hopefully you can get some rest!!! That's what has helped me. My BP number are still high but not to the point of delivering pre term since I have been on leave.",

            "answer": "Thanks for sharing, I think I can keep bp down so I dont develop even higher bp, wait n see. we are closing in our house Friday, moving in with in-laws for 3-5 weeks before our house is finished. Baby could come while we are still there, due 12-28! So thankful we sold house but timing is not ideal. I may book a pedicure or something fun to get me out of house while everyone is moving our stuff while I sit idly by!",

            "answer": "I think if your not there during the move that would be best! That way your not tempted to help like I did lol which I think caused my BP to go higher. Taking it easy and relaxing is the best thing you can do :) if your not feeling well lying on your left side will help your BP to go down. An at home BP monitor can help as well. Good luck with everything :)",

    "question": "went for my 36 week appt and bp was 130/70, normally 100/60ish, retaining fluid in ankles and calves. I have been over doing it at work, packing to move, paimting our new house and it has finally caught up to me. Doc said I need to put feet up after work, increase water, so hard!!! We are moving this weekend, guess I won't be helping. Anyone have an issue \"taking it easy\", have gestational hypertension or have it turn into preclampsia?",
