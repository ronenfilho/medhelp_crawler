            "answer": "Hi!If you were my patient, I would advise you that the risk of having pre-eclampsia again depends to a certain extent on how far along you were when you developed it the first time.\u00a0\u00a0It also depends upon how severe it was, and if this baby's father is the same as your older child's father.If you had a mild case at term, the risk that you will have it again is pretty low.\u00a0\u00a0If you had a severe case and if you have the same partner, your could be at higher risk.\u00a0\u00a0Pre eclampsia is almost always less likely with the second and subsequent child.Good luck!Dr B",
