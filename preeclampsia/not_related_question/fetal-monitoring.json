    "question": "I'm currently 5 days overdue. At 40 wks my dr wrote me an order to go to the hospital and get fetal monitoring to check on baby and to make sure my fluid level is still good. However, when I called labor & delivery the woman who answered seemed confused about this. Now I'm wondering if it's actually necessary. Baby is moving just fine and I've had no abnormal pains, bleeding, or anything. Has anyone ever had to go in just to get fetal monitoring?",
