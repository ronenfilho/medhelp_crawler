            "answer": "With my first epidural it went great; wasn't painful, easy. I was in early labor for over 24 hours and I slept like a baby the night before my daughter was born thanks to the epidural. However, that next morning I decided to let it wear off as active labor stared and I never pushed the button...so when she was born at 2PM that afternoon, it had worn off and I pushed her out without a problem; the labor was very painful, but totally do-able. I did tear, and I was lucky I had the epidural in because they were able to transfer me to the OR and simply turn up the medicine instead of having to take the time to knock me out or place another catheter or do a spinal, because I was in the OR for 1 1/2 hours getting sewn up and I nearly bled to death; probably would've done so in the time it would've taken them to anesthetize me if the epidural hadn't been in place! however, that is a SUPER rare complication and most women don't have to worry about it, lol.So with my second delivery I wanted an epidural in \"just in case\"....but it was AWFUL. The anesthesiologist couldn't get through the calcification on my spine to place the catheter, so he had to stick me several times, and it was horribly painful. He told me if he didn't get it on the next stick I wouldn't be getting an epidural. He got it in! it was great for 10 minutes, because I had back labor and it was excruciating. And....then the epidural stopped working :-(. They put some more medicine in and it helped but then it stopped working again. So I pushed baby #2 out without any numbing as well...no tears, quick recovery, WONDERFUL labor experience despite the awful back labor!So when baby #3 gets here in April, I'll be skipping the epidural. Lol. after 2 times pushing a baby out with no pain relief and one AWFUL epidural experience, I think I'm ready to go this alone, even if I have back labor again. I WAS happy to have it with my daughter, but after my traumatic experience with my son, I don't want to risk it again.It's entirely up to you whether you feel ready to give an epidural another shot. (no pun intended, lol). There's about a 50/50 chance that you'll have a great epidural, but there's also a chance that because you have a bad history with them you might have a bad experience...it really depends on whether you're more afraid of a bad epidural or of labor pains. For me, the times he stuck me and the pain went from my toes to my scalp, that was almost more painful than the labor and I don't want to go through that again. but if you have long labors and getting an epidural would help you rest enough to push...that's something to really consider. 'I do plan to accept IV pain meds if I need them, but I'm excited to try some of the birthing techniques I've used to cope with the pain. If a situation arose where I needed an epidural for some reason and couldn't cope without it, I would accept it. But....knowing my history and knowing that it could cause the same excruciating pain with the same useless result as it did last time..it would have to be a VERY good reason, lol.",

Hence...I went without it. But I know EVERYONE is different.You could research some birthing techniques and see if you might want to go commando this time. If you have quick labors...it might be worth skipping the voodoo doll session to your back. I'm not saying in ANY way that getting an epidural is a bad idea...I just get the feeling you are already freaked out by the chance of having another failed one with strange side effects.I have heard that recovery is easier without one too but...if you had a tear, like Ashelen did...you might have to deal with some other emergency pain reliever. So many things to consider!\u00a0\u00a0I had no tearing but I think that was because I labored in water. If there are tubs at your birth center...try it! It is a great pain reliever for a lot of women. I felt so much relief in the water.anyways! Good luck to you and congrats!",
