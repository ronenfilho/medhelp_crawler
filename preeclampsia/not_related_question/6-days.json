            "answer": "I just called my doctor because I can't take the pain anymore I have closer to two weeks until I'm due but they moved my appointment from Friday to today to see if they can find any reason to induce me. My husband also has to be out of town the following two weeks (which we just found out) and if I go into labor and he can't get here I will have to have the baby all alone because I don't have any friends in the area that can be there and I have no family that lives close at all",

            "answer": "Im so sorry that you might have to do it alone. I already planned that I'm doing it alone a long time ago, I feel as though it is better for me honestly. I want to have my baby before June 1st because her father is moving to Cali (from NY) for good. I really want him to see his daughter before he leaves. Im also sick of feeling sick honestly. Im not supposed to be on bedrest but it's like I am because if I do anything I feel sick as a dog. (terrible saying but you know lol) I've been uncomfortable since week 30. I keep feeling like Im getting my period, but the cramps dont get bad enough to be labor. I went into the hospital to get checked b/c i felt like the babys head was scraping against my bone and my back was cramping, but I got sent home b/c I was the same as when I had my appointment a few days earlier. Then when i went to the dr I dilated 2 more cm and effaced 20% more. They thought I was going to have her that weekend, but yet here I am still uncomfortable and feeling crappier than ever :/",
