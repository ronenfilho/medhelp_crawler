            "answer": "Hi thereEvery birth is different but the majority of people will not need stitches unless there is a medical emergency and a cesarian is neccesary or the baby has to be forcefully removed vaginally.I had three births and I had epidural for the pain and it was fine. The contractions are quite painful as they get stronger but the gas and air really takes the edge off it .\u00a0\u00a0They do the epidural about half an hour before the birth when they have checked how far dilated your womb is. (10cm I think)I only had stitches with the first baby but that was because he was getting stressed and had pooed inside me which is dangerous incase it goes into his lungs.\u00a0\u00a0They used a vontuse suction thing and basically pulled him out (a doctor was called to do it)\u00a0\u00a0I had several small tears and quite a few stitches and had to sit on a pillow for a week from the swelling but this was preferable to a cesarean operation which I narrowly avoided.\u00a0\u00a0The internal stiches are the most uncomfortable but they only last a couple of weeks .It is unlikely you will need any stitches unless there is an emergency during the birth try to keep relaxed as if you are stressed the baby will be too.",

            "answer": "Once I started pushing my labor was uncomplicated. She did get stuck for a few minutes, but I was able to continue. I had 16 stitches and had a 2nd degree tear and still required an episiotomy to give birth.",

            "answer": "Wow, my experience wasn't that bad.\u00a0\u00a0My labor just felt like it was hard to breath and I couldn't move during the time.\u00a0\u00a0After a day of this pain getting progressively worse I went to the hospital, they monitored me for an hour and then told me that I was far enough along they would admit me.\u00a0\u00a0They gave me my epidural right thenn and there and told me to get some sleep because in 5 hours I would start pushing. I then tried to sleep but didn't, and didn't feel any pain just a little uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I pushed for three hours and should have only pushed for 15 minutes but I was scared so don't be scared just push with all your might and it will be over faster.\u00a0\u00a0I think I might of gotten stiches but I didn't ask because frankly I didn't want to know.\u00a0\u00a0Just go in with the attitude that you can do it, and you will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly you don't care about stiches, pain or anything about you after you see your baby for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0I fell in love and I am so looking forward to it again in a little over 7 weeks!",

            "answer": "I had a bad labor, but I won't get into details about it. I had back labor really badly as well as hyperemesis, preeclampsia, and SPD. I pushed so hard that I gave myself hemorrhoids because she was stuck and I was determined not to have a cesarean.Also, after you have your baby, your focus isn't really on yourself or how badly you hurt. At least mine wasn't anyways.",
