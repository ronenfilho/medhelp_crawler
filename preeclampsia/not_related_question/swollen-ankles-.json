    "question": "I'm currently 15w and Saturday evening, my boyfriend and I went to an outdoor wedding. While we were waiting for the services to begin, I glanced down and noticed that both of my ankles had swollen to the size of softballs. I figured that it's nothing to be concerned over, I started propping them up when I noticed they were getting puffy yesterday, but I was still wondering if swollen feet were common this early in pregnancy or if I should be concerned? Thanks!",
