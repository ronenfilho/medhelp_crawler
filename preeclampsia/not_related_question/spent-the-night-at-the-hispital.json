            "answer": "For me 6.5 is good because as long as everything else is reassuring then it means I don't have to deliver too early and it means that resting more and hydrating have been enough for me to remain stable without hospitalization or bed rest. It's not what I would choose but I try to stay positive. AFI is an imprecise measurement at best. Whether it's 6.5 or 14 or even below 5 in late pregnancy there is little evidence to suggest poor outcomes for the baby absent other accompanying factors like preeclampsia or non-reassuring NST suggesting cord commpression. It does make vaginal delivery potentially risky especially with a breech. I'm in the exact same boat as you and I do know what it's like. I'm sorry this has been so stressful for you but it sounds like you are receiving good care and that bodes well for both of you. Best of health and joy to you on Monday!",
