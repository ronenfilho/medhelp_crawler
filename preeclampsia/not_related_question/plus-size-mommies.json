She looked at me and said conception isn't possible at my size well 2 weeks later I had 3 positive pregnancy tests. I beat myself up for 2 whole weeks thinking I was never going to be a mother and ignored every pregnancy symptom I had because it was not possible. Tomorrow I have my first appointment and im worried something wrong be right all because that woman said I couldnt conceive. :( I want to be excited but not until after I see that we are okay. But thank you all for the wonderful news that us bigger chicks can have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.",
