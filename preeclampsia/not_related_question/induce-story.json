            "answer": "For my daughter i had to get induced because my water level was low. So i went in on dec.14 at 7am and got plugged to the machines they put me an iv and it was good for the first few hours, then in the afternoon around maybe 1 or so i got contractions so badly to thepoint where i toldthe doctors if i can get morphine and i did...twice, then when i was 7cm dialated they took me to another room put me the epidural and to be honest i though it was gonna hurt but i didnt really feel it, they told me lay back and in 5 min my legs dropped i couldnt feel anything above my waist and in 20 min my water broke and almost 2 hours later she was born on dec 15 at 6 am lol so it wasa long day and night but so worth it when you see your baby and hold it for the first time, you forget about the pain. And in 2 hours i was already walking like nothing had happened. Good luck and congrats",

            "answer": "With me they did a folie balloon to help me dialate to 4cm. Then they started the pitocin at a very slow pace. At 6am they broke my water and it went very fast from there. There was a lot of walking during all of this. I did no pain medication so I walked around for a long time. This all started at 7pm January 2nd and I had her at 5pm January 3rd.",

But other than that I was ok baby was ok.\u00a0\u00a0That's really all that matters.\u00a0\u00a0Again I was way overdue.\u00a0\u00a0I would have went up there with the jaws of life. I was so ready to be done with pregnancy. Oh and when last stage of labor finally came I only had to push 3 times. No tearing nor stiches. Best wishes. I have until Nov. with this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, you're lucky! :)",

Lol I'm not taking the epidural since we aren't allowed to in my family and I'm a big baby with pain so that scares me even more. I'm at a 3 already and I've been walking so much hoping he decides to come on his own tonight.",

Started at 7am with pitocin, broke water at 9am, epidural around 11am, slept until 2 that afternoon when I woke up to be checked. 15 minutes later I was pushing and had my son at 2:59. I was terribly afraid too, and even still scared for this 2nd time around. Each labor is different! But everyone did tell me I would have a hard time.",

When it's time to push. Push with all you got during the contractions and the pain is so much less. You got this.",
