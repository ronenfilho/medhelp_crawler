            "answer": "Depending on how high your bp and protein levels are they are probably going to induce you, if they feel you will be okay a few more days they may wait til you hit 37 weeks. With my first I was monitored close for preeclampsia and kept my hospital bag in the car just in case. They may also have you go do a nst to see how baby is doing if they decide to let you go to 37 weeks.",

    "question": "I'm 36w + 3d and I had to do a 24 hour urine due to protein in my pee and increased blood pressure. Well I got a call late last night telling me that I needed to come in today because my tests came back abnormal (meaning I probably have preclampsia). What happens when you're diagnosed with it this late? My husband is scared they are going try and induce me when I go in today after reading up preclampsia.So does anyone have any experience with this? What happens?",
