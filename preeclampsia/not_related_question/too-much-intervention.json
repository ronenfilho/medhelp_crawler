I think most of them are being induced prior to their due dates because of health risks.. like the mom having high blood pressure or gestational diabetes, etc. My doctor only mentioned about inducing me if I go past 41 weeks, which of course, also depending on my health and my baby.",

            "answer": "Since I started seeing the doctor I'm with, she told me from the get go that she induces all of the patients at 39 weeks, because she is a one person practice so by inducing, it's like a way of making sure she will be there I guess. I have gone naturally into labor with my two previous pregnancies, even with my previous where I developed preeclampsia at the end of my pregnancy. I am currently 37 weeks and I'm hoping I go into labor all by myself again because I do not want to be induced, especially after reading that most inductions end up in c-sections. I definitely don't want a c-section unless it's super necessary of course.",

I do understand how it can be needed in some cases, but if not, i'd try avoid it. A normal pregnancy is between 37 and 42 weeks. Unless my gynaecologist sees any problems, i'm just gonna accept all the uncomfortabelness until my baby and body say it's time lol.",

And maybe the joy you hear from individuals are happiness to make it to the end without losing their child.",

(She's below the 10 percentile) so if she doesn't grow much, she would benefit more from being outside than inside at 39 weeks. (According to the doctor) So, for now, I have been doing fetal monitoring and fluid level checks 2 times a week.According to the monitoring, I've been having contractions like crazy (most I haven't been feeling. But I feel the big ones for sure.)So, I'm crossing my fingers that she makes her debut naturally.",
