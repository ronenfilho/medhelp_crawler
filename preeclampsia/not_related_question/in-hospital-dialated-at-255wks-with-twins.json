    "question": "I went to a sono yesterday after noon for the major measurements when the sono lady said she needed to speak to my dr. I went from a 4 in cervix to a short cervix with the top \"funneling\" and diated about 3 cm.I'm only 25.5 weeks..the babies are healthy but they just found out that I have a mucus something between the bulging sac and my cervix showing the sac has been exposed. Dr. says now that chances of me getting to 28 weeks now are less than 50% :( we don't know what to think.. we are at a hospital with a level 3 nicu? We picked it for this exact reason .we are worried. They are giving me steriod shots andmagnesium....anyone been through this or have any advice? I'm so scared. I wanted to see our babies but not like this...not this soon",
