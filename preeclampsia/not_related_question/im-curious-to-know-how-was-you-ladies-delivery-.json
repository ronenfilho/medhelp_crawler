            "answer": "Hi! My birth wishlist included a natural labor and vaginal birth. i let that guide my actions, which included laboring at home for much of the time. the hospital is only 4 miles from our home. My contractions started shortly after midnight. They came every hour for the first three hours, then quickened to 15 min. by 5AM.\u00a0\u00a0We hired a doula to assist us through birth (highly recommend!) and she encouraged me to soak in a tub of water. Well, rather than relaxing me, the bath water seemed to quicken my contractions to about 6 min. apart. That was around 6:30AM. I had to get out and immediately was overwhelmed with an urge to push. it took all my concentration not to. The mucus plug came out at this time. i used my birthing ball to rest on all fours to take pressure off my back and pelvis. my DH provided counterpressure on my hips with each contraction.My doula observed my progress and timed the contractions and said its time to transfer to the hospital at 7AM. It took us awhile to get out of the house because of the contractions and DH was still packing our bags!! Go ahead and pre-register at your hospital to make check-in easier. The last thing you want to think about is presenting your ID and filling out paperwork. The moment I sat down in the wheelchair my water broke. The triage nurse confirmed I was fully dilated and ready to be transferred to the L&D room.There were so many hospital staff in the L&D room, at least 7, all buzzing around loudly. It quite pissed me off. I told my doula I couldn't concentrate on giving birth with all the distractions. She shut them up and my OBGYN took over by turning down the lights and getting everyone ready. The nurses were trying to put my legs in the stirrups and take over. i refused since laying on my back was so uncomfortable. i stayed on my side, while my DH held my leg. After you're fully dilated the pain kinda melts away. The contractions are no longer pushing the pelvic bones apart but are now important to push baby out, which is more of a burning sensation. The most difficult moment was when my daughter was crowning. It was the \"ring of fire\" that I heard other moms talk about. I tore a bit and eventually needed stitches, but that's very common. Once the head is out, the shoulders, rest of the body and placenta are all easy. The nurses were also trying to put a paper cloth across my chest to keep me \"clean\" when I held my newly birthed daughter. But I declined that also. I also made sure to hold and comfort her for as long as possible, even with the cord still attached, until she was wiped down and examined.The first few hours afterwards I was very dizzy because I had lost a good amount of blood. I needed assistance when getting up, which I didn't mind. My muscles and bottom were sore and weak. I continued to bleed for a full five weeks. I hear of moms having abdomen pains after cesarean births, but vaginal births leave you feeling like your bottom is about to fall off.From my first contraction to birth, total labor was 8 hrs. we were home as a family within 36 hrs. I know this is a lot of info and each mother has her own unique experience, but hope its helpful in some way for you.",

It's not for everyone, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The hardest part were the last 2 hours of contractions and the two pushes it took to get her out. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I had my baby boy April 15th. He's my first baby and will be for a very long time! My labor experience wasn't too bad, could've been worse. I was scheduled to get Induced today, the 19th at 39 weeks, but when I went In for my weekly appt. , my preeclampsia was worse so they decided to Induced me that day, which was the 14th. I was already dilated to a 3 before the Induction process. I started the process at 3:54 PM, they put this Gel stuff\u00a0\u00a0(sorry I don't remember the name) Inside me every 3 hours to soften my cervix and start my contractions to a constant pattern and dilate me more. Contractions were painful, but were tolerable enough that I didn't need any medication. Didn't have to have the potocin drip (spelling?) So the next day, the 15th, around 12 P.M. they broke my water. Now that's were the contractions got extremely painful, but was able to manage without the epidural. They gave me this one medication In my IV\u00a0\u00a0that was supposed to help with the pain not bein' too painful, but It didn't work for me. I was In a lot of pain and finally asked for the Epidural but was told It was too late and I had to start pushing. It made me wish I asked for It earlier but I'm happy with the outcome. Yes, It was very painful for me, and towards the end I slowed down and didn't want to push anymore 'cuz of how much pain I was In and bein' very tired for constant pushing for a few hours, but everyone Is different. I had my baby boy at 3:15 P.M.. I did tear and felt every bit of It when It happened. I'd rather deal with labor without the Epi again for a day without tearing, then having to deal with this stupid tear for a week or so, It burns very badly every time I have to pee and It kinda hurts\u00a0\u00a0when I have to sit down, I have to take my time to sit down or else It hurts. Other than the tearing part, I think my labor wasn't all that bad. It defiantly Is worth It for my precious baby boy.",
