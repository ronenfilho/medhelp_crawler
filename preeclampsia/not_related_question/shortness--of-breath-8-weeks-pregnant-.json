            "answer": "I've had a lot of shortness of breath problems. It wasn't preeclampsia or pulmonary embolism. I did allow for a single chest xray but I was 24 weeks at the time. My SOB started 14 weeks pregnant with a single baby. I had tons n of tests done. And everything was normal. Turns out it's a combination of things. There is a pregnancy hormone that causes increased respirations. I'm short and the uterus pushes on my diaphragm and lungs. My iron levels may be normal for the average person, but I don't tolerate those levels. I have to take 50 mg of a non constipating highly absorbable iron supplement. But mostly I have tons of excess fluid in my tissues and my heart has to work extra hard. My chest xray was normal but you can still have fluid in your lung tissues that can't be picked up by xray. Enough to make you symptomatic. You can reduce your salt intake, drink tons of fluids, exercise in a pool (the pressure of the water helps push fluid from the tissues back into the veins), wear compression socks, elevate feet as much as possible without compressing the diaphragm,\u00a0\u00a0eat/drink foods that are natural diuretics like dandelion root tea, eat foods that are natural anti-inflammatory (just Google those), avoid foods that cause inflammation (dairy, meats), take an iron supplement (I like floridix), and stave off fatigue as much as possible. Sleep! It's hard for me to follow all these things. Rest, elevation, compression socks, light exercise, and iron has helped me the most.",

            "answer": "I started like that in my 2nd trimester when I would be sleeping during the night. It felt like I was getting chocked. After I delivered my twins it had turned out I had a pulmonary embolism that had traveled to my left lung it was the size of a dime but close enough to my heart. That I could've died. Well now Obgyn can detect it early. Are you're legs, femur bone feet or calfs very swollen? From what I was told it means the blood is not circulating properly and that's were my blood cloth started. I recommend you talk to you're gynecologist. That is something you shouldn't play with. Trust me I'm on blood thinners with my 3rd pregnancy even though it happen 7 years ago for me. And at that time when I was pregnant with twins I was and still have asthma but it was under control and is still is.",

            "answer": "Hello sorry for the late reply i just got out of the hospital. I dont have any swelling\u00a0\u00a0or pain in my legs. I just have shortnes of breatg feel like my throat\u00a0\u00a0and cheat feels tight. They did me a d dimer test to look for blood clots it came back 0.30 which apparently\u00a0\u00a0positive\u00a0\u00a0but normal for pregnant women. They also did nore blood work which came back fine and also a ecg for my heart which qas also fine. They didnt want to do a xray cause of the babies. Which im glad so the lung specialist cane down to see my results and conclusion is he thinks its more asthma then clot to the lung. I do have a ultrasound for lower legs to rule that out aswell.i still\u00a0\u00a0feel ahort of breath im so scares it could be a blood clot in my lungs but wouldnt they have left me in hospital if thats the case? I can breath normal it just feels tight also i have no pain when i breath.",

The fluid in my lungs still can't be detected by any tests. But it's there. It's not dangerous if I take it easy. And it doesn't sound like you have a clot.",
