            "answer": "I went through that exactly. I had my son 4 yrs ago at 35weeks by emergency c section due to preeclampsia. I had problems from the very first week we found out i was pregnant. It was an extremely rough pregnancy. I didn't enjoy it. I counted the weeks not to my due date but to a week where he could be born and actually survive. After i had him i was really down. The delivery and him coming early and staying in the nicu. But once he was a couple weeks old i started to miss being pregnant. Bad. We decided to try for another baby once my son hit 4months. But i couldn't get pregnant. That made me feel even worse. The docs said i was infertile cuz of all my reproductive problems. I got really depressed since i didn't even enjoy my first pregnancy. It took 3.5yrs to get pregnant again. Im now 26weeks with my daughter and even though this pregnancy is kicking my butt like my sons Im enjoying every min of it since my husband and i decided this will be the last.I wish i had some advice to give you. But i unfortunately never got over the dumps until i got pregnant again.",

            "answer": "Talk to your dr or a nurse, it could just be hormones it could also be the baby blues or PND. It won't hurt to check it out and talk to someone. If it is PND it's better to catch it earlier than just trying to ride it out.Good luck and I hope things look brighter for you soon.",
