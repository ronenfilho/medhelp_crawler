            "answer": "First of all, it's still natural if you have an epidural. My first I had two days of prelabor that meant zero sleep for 48 hours. Then twelve hours of active labor. I had to take phentonol and gas because I was so exhausted that I was in no frame of mind to labor well. However, I am convinced it slowed down my labor. So with my second I wanted to go drug free. I did, but my entire labor starts to finish was only 6.5 hours. So be easy on yourself. Have a plan if you want, but remember labor rarely goes as expected. I have a friend who was exhausted from 13 hours labor and the labor had sort of stalled. So she asked for an epidural. Fifteen minutes after she got it, she was pushing. It had allowed her labor to get going again. So in her case it was a good thing. You'll be a champion no matter how you get that baby out.",
