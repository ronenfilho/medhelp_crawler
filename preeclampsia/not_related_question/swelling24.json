            "answer": "MamaMacMurtry is correct. Also don't put your feet above your heart as that requiresyou to lay on your back which you sshouldn't do for more than a few moments. Place a few pillows under your feet and just elevate your legs above your hips, the fluid will slowly drain in a few minutes. Also the tingling in your fingers is normal its caused by the swelling which is putting pressure on some of your nerves. I'm 34 weeks and i have the same issues. It'll go away after pregnancy not immediately but in a short time.",
