            "answer": "I get a pretty bad headache on the left side of my head about once or twice a week since I found out I was pregnant. I'm 24 weeks now and realized about 8 weeks ago that I'm getting caffeine headaches. I found that drinking 2-4 ounces of soda with caffeine actually helps it go right away. This makes sense for me because I was used to drinking a cup or 2 of coffee everyday for 4 years and the moment I found out I was pregnant I stopped drinking coffee. Anyways, I hope this helps you, doll. Good luck.",

            "answer": "i was just in l and d with very bad headache and neck pain that i had for about four days nonstop. My doctor saw i couldnt even bend and touch my knee and she became very worried and sent me back to the hospital but thank God all blood work came back negative for preeclampsia and menegitis which she thought could also be a possibility of all the symptoms i was having. My headach just started getting better yesterday that i started drinking here and there a little bit of coffee which a cup of water afterwards. If drinking caffeine makes it better then definitely its just a migraine. Im 36&5 and fifth baby and this pregnancy has been so difficult i was terrified when i became ill with that huge amd sever migraine. GOD IS GOOD, hope you feel better soon.",
