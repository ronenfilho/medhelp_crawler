            "answer": "Do you live in America or another country? I believe in America it is the law that the employer must give you 6 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. You may also use FMLA which is 12 weeks of unpaid time off.\u00a0\u00a0You can usually get paid during those times by using your sick time and/or disability. Disability will pay once you have the baby, but usually not before delivery unless you have a medical reason and they do not consider pregnancy a medical reason. That has been my experience anyways. Call and talk to your disability company and get the details.",
