            "answer": "Good luck.. It's hard & painful, I wish I could say different. W my 1st my water broke & I hadn't started dilating. So they put me in pitocin to \"induce\" me, move contractions along & hopefully speed up dilating. For me it didn't at all. After 17 hrs of labor-no pain meds, I ended up w an emergency Csection. My gf was induced @ 41+wks, she ended up having a vag delivery after 14hrs of labor. And pitocin is an evil drug.. It makes contractions come closure together, they're harder, stronger etc.",

            "answer": "Before you go the pitocin route, why not try an acupuncture induction? It's effective and drug free.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard many stories about how pitocin makes contractions extremely painful for you and the baby. Then many women end up with epidural, and getting an epidural increases your chances of having a cesarean.",
