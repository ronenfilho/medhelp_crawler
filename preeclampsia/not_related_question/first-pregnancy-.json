It doesnt. I'm due in 11 days and still have 3 a day which my dr said is fine as long as I'm not stressed. I would say chew gum or eat candy like suckers, it keeps your mouth occupied.. maybe get active (not too active of course) just find things that can hopefully distract you from thinking about smoking. I've also heard if you take away the cigarette you want the most first (like after you eat or something) then it also makes it easier. I hope this helps you! And makes sure to drink plenty of water! :)",

The doctor advised me quitting cold Turkey can cause a miscarriage as he said all pregnancies and all women don't necessarily go through that. But he also stated to do it slowly because that risk is still present. If you want to call us selfish because we can't \"just quit\" then you need to get off this post.

They are saying it is all a matter of will power and you just have to do it. There is no magic way to kick it other than to just grit your teeth and go for it.Also that bit about miscarriage from quitting cold turkey is a complete lie. Quitting cold turkey will raise stress levels true but that alone isn't enough to cause a bloody miscarriage.

I don't care what anyone's doctor told them MY doctor told me to wing myself off of it. I think I trust the person with a medical degree more. Every pregnancy is different and I know women who quit cold turkey and had a miscarriage. I'd rather take my doctors advice than to quit in an moments notice because the risk is still there. Just because YOU and other women didn't have one doesn't mean I won't. We don't have the same body despite the same body parts. Everyone's body is different as well as every pregnancy",

Yes for some people quitting cold turkey can be more dangerous than having a few a day. Like with every other part of pregnancy, everyone and every situation is different, but if i may give a bit of advice, if you,do manage to quit during the pregnancy dont start back after you have the baby, it still has negative effects on the child. And it is better for you. My grandpa died from lung cancer and my mom is losing a battle with COPD.

No need to be rude. Believe it or not sometimes doctors recommend you keep smoking a little if you are really stressed and have high blood pressure or preeclampsia because quitting could be even more dangerous. Don't believe me ask my cousin. She had hypertension/preeclampsia and high blood pressure and was so stressed from trying to quit it made her sick and her doctor told her not to quit because she would end up possibly losing her baby. Smoking actually saved her baby's life and he's perfectly healthy. Obviously this isn't the case for everyone but don't bash someone until you know their story.",
