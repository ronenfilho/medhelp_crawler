I started it Sunday morning and brought it in Monday morning. I don't know if waiting a day would alter the results, but that is what they told me. Hope this helps, and good luck!!",

            "answer": "you can keep it in the fridge.I did the 24 hour sample just before 36 weeks. I handed it in Friday. 8:00 Monday morning my OB called me and told me to get to the hospital- he had to do a c-section that day because my kidneys were spilling protein into my urine. He also did a blood test on Friday which apparently showed my platelets were low, indicating liver problems. Basically, as soon as he had the lab results, he decided the baby had to delivered.So... that's the only reason why I wouldn't have wanted to wait any extra days. With preeclampsia, time can be an issue. Just please watch yourself for symptoms over the weekend, and if you find yourself not feeling well, go to the hospital. That weekend I felt so horrible,\u00a0\u00a0and in retrospect I realize that I should have gone to the hospital.Another factor that lead to his quick decision- an ultrasound showed the placenta starting to calcify (caused by preeclampsia). How recently have you had an ultrasound?",

    "question": "Ok, so based on my increased swelling, 6 pound weight gain in 1 1/2 weeks (I have continualy gained too much weight at each appointment) and increasing blood pressure (low my BP isn't high) the doctor decided to order that I do the 24-hour urine sample to check for pre-clampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I am 36 1/2 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, I am doing this over the weekend and I have a baby shower to go to on Sunday as well as a birthday party on Saturday night so the only time I can really do this is starting tomorrow through Saturday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, the lab isn't open on Saturdays, so is leaving the urine in my refrigerator ok for 1 1/2 days after completing the sample???\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told me that he will induce me next week if my protein levels are over 300, but if they are under 300 then he will still end up inducing me but probably at 38-39 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to make sure I do this right so I have the correct results.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone could please let me know if they think this is ok, if not I may just have to cut my baby shower short because I really don't want to lug the pee sample jug with me and ask to store it in their fridge!",
