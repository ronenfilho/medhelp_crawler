I had high blood pressure at my 37 week appt but the Dr's think it was a fluke because within 30 minutes from the OB office to labor and delivery it was back to normal and was near perfect at my appt 2 days ago. Other than that a few slight headaches but nothing severe.",

I went to bed abound round midnight and woke up at 5 to pee and didn't have to go again until now...10. It's also very little coming out. I have been eating and drinking the same since the beginning and of course Google tells me I have 3 life threatening diseases lol just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Baby seems to be moving fine and nothing else has changed besides some back aches and cramping",
