            "answer": "I was induced with my first on my due date due to high blood pressure. It took a long time for me to get into active labour. 4 days. I had the pessary that they changed every 24hrs and then once I got to 4cms I was taken to labour ward to have my waters broke. I had every drug available, gas and air, pethidine and then I had an epidural. The midwife advised me to have one as I was so tired and also my bp was up and down and she said it would settle it. Well it slowed everything down for me and I ended up with a forceps delivery. Thats not to say you will have one. The drugs are there to be used so if you feel you want them have them. The end result ia the same. Your beautiful baby in your arms. However I had a natural birth for my second and it was totally different and if I don't have to be induced with this one I will be going natural again just because I felt it was alot quicker, less intense and more manageable with being in control with breathing techniques. But every women is completely different and I heard many ladies have really quick inductions. Best of luck x",

            "answer": "If its safest for you to be induced then that's what needs to happen. I was induced on my first, didn't want pain meds but when you are in labour you think differently and your coping skills tend to go out of the window. I had them all! Go with the flow and don't put too much pressure on yourself to not have any pain relief. If you need them, have them!",

            "answer": "getting induced makes your contractions so strong and intense that I honestly thought I was dying. Seriously could not catch a break from the induced contractions that I just thought I was gonna die. It was very painful for me. With pmy induction I could not relax and was tensing up from the pain that I was not dilating. I was on level 10 of pitpcin (max) and my contractions were back to back very very strong and i wasn't even progressing because the pain had me so tense. There'snow aat I could have breathed thru those intense contractions. They were way too strong for me. My midwife said if I keep going like this the baby will stress too much and I will end up getting a csection since I was not dilating from being so tense from the pain. I tried every postion possible. Tried the bath tried the ball my bf was even holding me at one point. So I finally agreed to the epidural and it saved me from surgery. As soon as I got it I was able to relax and I dilated to a 10 sooo fast. I tried so hard without the epidural cuz that was my plan but if I had stuck with my plan with no meds I would have had a csection. So thank god for the epidural! I'd rather get the epidural then being\u00a0\u00a0cut open and having to deal with the recovery from major surgery while taking care of a newborn. The epidural wore off an hour after delivery and I felt fine. Baby was super healthy and awake. He came out and latched on to my breast right away. Very happy with the epidural. :) 3 years later and I still don't have anything bad to say about the epidural.",
