            "answer": "Lots of women have to take pain killers during pregnancy. If you are talking about mild headaches, etc. and looking for something over the counter, tylenol is considered safe.\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from Ibuprofen products (unless it is low dose asprin many of us are prescribed).\u00a0\u00a0If you are talking about pain requiring something stronger, Dr.'s base their decision on benefit vs. risk.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to take only as prescribed and work closely with both the Dr. managing the pain and your OB. THere is high risk in taking more then prescribed or abusing them.\u00a0\u00a0If that is the case, do not stop cold turkey, but work with your Dr. and be completely honest.\u00a0\u00a0The health of your baby relies on it. Best of luck to you!",
