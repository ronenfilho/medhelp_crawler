    "question": "I have 63 days left to go, at week 30. I think I was having bh contractions last night.\u00a0\u00a0They started at about 6-8 min apart lasting for 30-40 seconds,\u00a0\u00a0then went to 3-4 minutes apart still lasting for 30-40 seconds. This all happened for about 2-3 hours, until I was so exhausted That I fell asleep. I tried laying down, standing,\u00a0\u00a0sitting,\u00a0\u00a0rocking everything to see if they would stop but nothing worked. Now this morning I feel like I did a huge long work out yesterday on my abs back and butt.\u00a0\u00a0Plus my baby girl feels really low now,\u00a0\u00a0she is still moving around allot but really low now.\u00a0\u00a0I feel so sick that I feel like throwing up but I am afraid it will start something again or hurt really bad. Could this just be bh contractions or the real thing??\u00a0\u00a0My stomach still feels really tight but I don't know if it's just from lay night or what.",
