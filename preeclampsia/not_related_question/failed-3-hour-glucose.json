            "answer": "My advice would be Go have one last \"hurrah\" because you won't be eating anything sweet for a LONG time. Go get an ice cream sundae or something. I have gestational diabetes and it really *****. You need to keep a log of everything you eat and you're only allowed to eat so many carbs at each meal. You'll be told to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks in between and you will be testing your blood sugar at least 4 times a day. On the plus side, you'll get ultrasounds just about once a week to monitor your baby's growth until you deliver, so you'll be seeing a lot of baby until delivery :) sorry you failed though :(",

            "answer": "Eat some ice cream for me too! Lol. Thankfully, my baby is only measuring in the 33rd percentile and her weight was 3lbs 2 weeks ago (at 30 weeks). My blood sugars have been in check pretty well so far but I've learned that fast food and potatoes really cause a spike so I'm avoiding them now. The nutritionist told me that 60 percent of women end up on insulin despite their best efforts. Thankfully I've only had 2 sugar spikes in over a week. I didn't have GD with my other kids and they were not even 6lbs at birth, so this risk of a bigger baby is new to me. Fingers crossed for all og us..heres to Normal sized babies! :)",

I've been checking my sugars every say 4 X's a day and have not had one issue with my sugar being too high and I have not made any changes to my diet other than smaller carb portions. Realistically, most women do not take in that much glucose in one meal unless they are really on a binge ...now I'm not saying that every women with gd is able to regulate their sugar with diet alone, every ones body is different and not everyone will find their situation matches mine however I just wanted to provide another outlook on the situation. Being able to check my blood sugar regularly and see how my body reacts to various foods has given me a lot of insight into my personal case.",

I didnt havecany problems with my last pregnancy and I craved banana splits with both pregnancies... I cried about having it for a week and was depressed about it too... I viewed food as the enemy.... but I found that I didn't have to make THAT many changes.... I stopped drinking soda and drank more water (got mio for flavor)... I still eat hamburgers but not the fries (salad instead).... and I eat a lot of fruit for breakfast (instead of poptarts or toaster strudel)... whole wheat pasta... I still eat potatoes but limit the amount... my baby isn t measuring big... I found out today (thank god) and my GD is being controlled with my diet... I've had growth scans my whole pregnancy since I had high blood pressure that went away (but still being monitored for preeclampsia) and learned today at 36 weeks I have to go twice a week for growth scans... I check my sugar levels 4 times a day-- thats the part that ***** the most (that and im sick of going to the doctor all the time and not thrilled it will increase)",

If you eat white rice change it to brown rice for now until you see nutritonist. It will be helpful if you start watching your carb intake. That is what turns into sugar.",

I've had two high readings in the last two weeks and both were potato related so I stay away from them now. The diet they have me on is 30-45 grams of carbs in the morning, 15-30g for all in between meal snacks, 45-60g for lunch and 45-60g for dinner. I eat a lot of Whole wheat bread, crackers, and drink milk to get my carbs in. I never seem to remember to snack in between which can be terrible for stabilizing blood sugar. Also, I just at some sugar and dairy free chocolate ice cream tonight (first dessert item attempt since my diagnosis) and I tested my sugars just to see. Got a totally normal reading. If you get a sweet tooth like me then try \"So delicious\" brand ice cream. Hopefully you'll have good luck with it too.",
