I didn't know if I was just losing it slowly because my mom said she did that with her pregnancies or if it's just because of being checked by the dr.",

I am hoping I have my baby soon. I am so ready. :)",

I was pretty sure it was my plug especially after waking up again this morning and there was a large blob in my undies (eww lol) I been feeling contractions all morning but they're irregular so I been trying to stay active to keep them coming lol. I was 3 cm dilated and 50% effaced at my 36 week check and still there at 37 (yesterday) so hopefully it will happen soon. It's weird getting passed the 37 week mark (I had my first the day I was 37 weeks) and not knowing when it's gonna happen. (Induced with first due to preeclampsia)",
