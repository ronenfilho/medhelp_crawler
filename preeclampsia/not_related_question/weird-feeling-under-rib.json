            "answer": "Hi,can your wife actually feel something when she touches the area , or is it just a feeling that something is there?. It would be very difficult to hazzard a guess as to what it might be, has she been doing any heavy lifting lately and maybe pulled a muscle ?. As nobody on this forum has medical training I think it would impossible to know what it could be. I would go to the doctor and ask for an ultrasound or an xray (could she have cracked a rib). There are so many possibilities . I hope you find the answer soon , keep us posted and good luck.Best wishes Angie",

I had to go on a bland diet for a few days till they could get me in for emergency surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Again we are not doctors, so please have your wife go to the doctor, because if it is gall bladder, it can rupture.good luck",
