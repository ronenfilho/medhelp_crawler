    "question": "So as the weather gets worse and the office closes the doctor decides to take days off and not call to reschedule.\u00a0\u00a0I have missed my last three appointments.\u00a0\u00a0They are so unprofessional, I have tried to get in with another doctor but because I am so far along they won't take me. I am just fed up and ready to just not see a doctor until I give birth. Heck all they do is tell me how much weight I have gained, make me pee in a cup and send me on my way!!! So far I have had an amazing pregnancy so there has been no need to run to the doctors or fear anything is wrong. I just need to vent, thanks for listening!",
