I went to the e.r. one day and had no protein in my urine and 2 days later had minuet amounts in my urine at my weekly check up. Hope everything works out for you!",

Not enough to diagnose preeclampsia so they call it pregnancy induced hypertension. I've been on bed rest for a little over a week and I'm not as swollen (though I am still puffy all over).Sometimes all the can do is tell you to take it easy. I hope your doctor can tell you good news when he gets back.",

If it does.. pitted edema. There's nothing you can do for it except drink lots of water and put your feet up when possible. The swelling will never really go down all the way. Good luck.",
