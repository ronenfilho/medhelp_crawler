You all are taking it to the extreme I personally have been sick every single day from week 3 I'm now 30+5 and still wake up every morning and throw my guts up until I go back to sleep. That doesn't mean I can't carry out everyday tasks and need to wrap myself in cotton wool from the rest of the world. Re read the post I'm simply saying some woman should relax when it comes to little trivial things and enjoy their pregnancy instead of being so uptight and not having the enjoyment of it. Some of you have twisted my words completely and turned it into a 'sarcastic attack' which is absolutely not what my intent was. I'm saying that it's okay to live your life as normal and not be so worried about every single thing that TO ME is just pure commen sense that these things won't harm you or your baby just like before how they wouldn't harm you in the slightest.",

I am a great skier, but cannot control others, and do fear being struck on the slopes by another....I will be 24 weeks/5 months at vacation time. Mexico would be cheaper, but I admit I know too many friends who get sick there to desire to go while pregnant. We will be going to Plain Ole Maui, where the risk from food, water, and crime rates are minimal.I love scuba diving, but will only be snorkelling this trip! 9 months is a very short period of time to live a little more boring life, in order to have a healthy pregnancy and child. My pet peeve is mom's who won't get help to quit drinking or using drugs while pregnant...Oh....and I am 43, this is my first pregnancy, and yes I gave up alcohol, caffiene, and improved over all consumption of organic foods and vitamins. I am a Director for a company, I work 50+ hours a week, and no one ther will know I am pregnant until I can physically not hide it anymore....Thank god I am tall and can wear a frumpy sweater vs. and 1-2 size bigger pants vs. maternity pants! I do all my regular chores at home, will plant my spring Vegie garden in next few weeks, and am doing some DYI home repairs bef I re baby comes....At 43, I was blessed with this natural pregnancy without physician assistance. I do not have to quit living and be a China doll, but I am old enough to understand RISK, and if my Dr. or other wise source provides me with advice to keep my baby safe, I am wise enough to take it!Women my age don't get knocked up naturally too often!Blessing to mum awaiting number 7 pregnancy! I prey this one will be without issue, and that you receive the blessing of a healthy child!",
