            "answer": "Getting pregnant again less than 12-18 months after delivering a baby can be dangerous for both mom and baby. Your body goes through HUGE changes during pregnancy and it takes time to heal and recover from that. It increases the risk of preterm labor and low birth weight, it decreases the amount of time that the mother is likely to breastfeed the first baby (who, as an infant, still desperately needs that nutrition and bonding) and it increases risks for mom such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.This doesn't mean that these things happen every time a mom has babies very close together.\u00a0\u00a0But the increased risk that has been proven is a good reason to take a closer look at your intentions.I personally wouldn't want to even think about putting myself through morning sickness and fatigue and all the other nasty symptoms of early pregnancy when I still had a tiny little infant waking at all hours of the night and not even be able to sit up independently. Being a mom to a brand new baby is HARD work.It's sweet that your boyfriend wants you to have another one right away. Remember how easy it is for him to say that when he doesn't have to fight through the physical part.I don't know your personal situation but statistically it's pretty unlikely that he will be doing 50% of the work of feeding and changing and rocking and bathing and dressing... and raising these babies. The brunt of it will likely be on you. And from your post it doesn't sound like either of you have done this before. My suggestion is to take it easy. Don't make any solid plans. See how you both feel after a couple months of really doing it. It is your body, that the little girl you're already carrying will need to have healthy and strong to keep her healthy and safe. You get to make the final decision about when you want to have more babies. Take care of your body. Take precautions until you are absolutely certain that it is the right time.",

I have to say that I loved every minute of bringing them up together. My daughter is now 10 and my son 9, they are so close and their bond is incredibly strong.Having said that I now realise that health wise it wasn't such a smart move coz in my second pregnancy I suffered from a very sore pelvic bone as my body didn't have the time it needed to recover. But it was all worth it.....I love my children and do not regret my choices. Do what is best for you. Think it through and speak to your partner....the choice is yours :-)",

They were both easy pregnancies unlike this third one 4 years later so you never know how your body will respond. I definitely would think about why you want another one so close if its just to get a boy I wouldn't do it. Good luck!",
