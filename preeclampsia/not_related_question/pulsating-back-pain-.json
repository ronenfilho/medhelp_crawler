            "answer": "thanks peek, it seems like the pain comes and i can feel my pulse but painfully from mid back down and hip to hip for about a minute. then it goes away and doesn't happen again for up to 15 minutes. i don't think there is any regularity to it. i am going to lie down for a couple hours and see if it abates. i can't tell if my abdomen is tightening, all i feel is elbows and knees and butts!! the girls are super low today. i think they are both under my belly button romping. btw...my blood work from monday is in. my platelet count was 150 k/mm . aside from that my lft's are within normal ranges(haven't seen the numbers myself, just gotten a nurses report) and my urine study showed 170 mg/dl. i go back thursday to talk about the joys of the pre-e. (just to follow up from last week :)\u00a0\u00a0)bizee, the pain is from mid back to the middle of my butt hip to hip. it feels like one of those headaches you get where you feel your pulse throbbing in your head, but in my back. lower back pain is new to me. i have been having left flank pain associated with my ever so lovely preeclampsia.",
