            "answer": "I developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy. My BP had been 104/60 consistently throughout my pregnancy. But when I went to L&D in labor, my BP was 150/100 and I had protein in my urine. My BP did not come down until I was put on BP meds post partum.The protein in your urine can be normal. You can have trace amounts of protein in your urine depending on many factors, and not have preeclampsia. I wouldn't worry about it unless your BP spikes up.As for the GD, they will make you take a 3 hour glucose test. If you fail that one, you will be monitored and have to watch your diet. It's not the end of the world, so try not to worry. Many expectant mothers develop GD. I've known several, and none of them went on to develop preeclampsia. Just keep a watch on your diet and your blood pressure and address any concerns with your OB at your next appt if you still feel things are off or you're worried.",
