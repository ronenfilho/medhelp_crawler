            "answer": "Breast feeding did not help me, it actually have me gained 20lbs. My cousin lost 50lbs breast feeding, it caused her to not have an appetite. Breast feeding caused me to have sugar cravings. I was not much of a sweet craving person, I will sometimes dilute my soda/sweet drinks before drinking. When I started to breast feed, I craved nothing but sweets and chocolate and that is what contribute to my weight gain. I am still breast feeding my toddler who will be two in January and has yet lose any baby weight with exercise and eating healthy.Some people lose weight with breast feeding after they wean, I am hoping with the pregnancy (baby #2) it won't be so hard to lose weight.",
