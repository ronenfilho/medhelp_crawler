            "answer": "Hi, Thank you very much for your questions; although it is quite difficult for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern. Your report suggests that could be due to either microvesicular ischemic disease of brain or combination of lyme\u2019s disease. However mainly in microvesicular ischemic disease of brain, pathology is associated with the brain white matter, either exclusively or in combination with grey matter changes. It occurs due to metabolism errors, exogenous toxins released by virus, autoimmune disease, leukodystrophy, demyelination, and radiation effects. Spasticity, muscle weakness, paralysis, hyper-reflexia and movement disorder may be the clinical features associated with white matter disease that need to be evaluated thoroughly. However, it is sad to say that there is no permanent cure but conservative treatment & physiotherapy exercises that would help you to regain your normal function and stopping the further progression of the disease. Please consult a neurologist in this regards. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "PROCEDURE: Sagittal T1. Axial T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusionCOMPARISON: CT from 2008FINDINGS: There is symmetric focal T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusioninvolving only the splenium of corpus callosum. The brain is otherwise normalin signal intensity on all pulse sequences. No hemorrhage, mass effect,extra-axial collection. The basilar flow-voids are present. The calvarium,skull base, craniocervical relationships, and visualized extracranialstructures are remarkable for mild mucoperiosteal thickening and polypoidchange in the paranasal sinuses.IMPRESSION: Isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosumis quite unusual in a patient without known history of multiple sclerosis,traumatic diffuse axonal injury, or status epilepticus. Consider drugtoxicity, transient metabolic derangement, encephalitis or ADEM, PML, rareneoplasm, or hypoglycemia. Doubt hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or posteriorreversible encephalopathy in the absence of known preeclampsia/eclampsia.I also had blood work done. It showed that i was positive for lymes disease. And the other day my blood sugar dropped to 57. So im not sure if im getting these symptoms neurological symptoms i should say from either hypoglycemia or lyme disease. i dont think i have ms. it doesnt run in the fam. idk help please",
