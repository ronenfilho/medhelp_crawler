            "answer": "119/87 is actually pretty good! :) normal range is 120/70. Anything over 140/85 is considered to be high. Your bottom number is a little high but not horrible! I am 35w3d and I have had constant high blood pressure since 26 weeks. Its always around 165/94. Since its been constantly high, I see my doctor every thursday for an ultrasound to check the babies heartbeat and fluid, a non-stress test, and a chat with my doctor! I also go in every wednesday to do blood work to check for preeclampsia. This week will be my 4th time doing it. He is inducing me in a week or two because my blood pressure wont go down! Just sharing my experience. Yours could be different! Good luck! :)",

            "answer": "Yeah yours is okay! Nothing to freak out over for sure :) mine was 150/100 most days!! That's when they really started to be concerned and talk about induction. So don't worry. Things you can try to keep it down are: relax, it is very important. Drink lots of water, about two liters a day. If you eat a lot of salt, cut way back. Salt is good to eat in small doses. So any foods high in sodium, avoid. That's basically all you can do, and you should be okay :)@rosie high blood pressure symptoms are blurred vision, white spots in your vision, possibly swelling of the feet or hands, headache, dizziness.",
