And my vision isn't blurred at all, i just see these kind of.. thick colors that block whatever im trying to see. and its not my whole vision, its not one eye or the other.As per it being reoccurring, i was trying to say that the dizziness and funny vision has semi happened before. it is by no b\\means frequent, to my knowledge.Anout the face going numb though, it along with the distorted vision goes away when i sit down. Which is why this is so confusing.i would say its completly unrelated, but ive been told i have astigmatism in one eye. again, not sure it matters, but trying to think of anything that could help.",

    "question": "Hi.So, on my first day at work with 30 minutes to go, my face goes numb, i get incredibly dizzy, and HAVE to crouch down or sit down for the symptoms to go away. Well, i did this over five times in a rows. Right when i had to stand up and work again the symptoms started back up immediately. and they got progressively worse when i tried to ignore it and continue to work.It got so bad that my vision was distorted and i couldn't see the hands or numbers on a clock that was about 10 feet away from me. I kept seeing colors as the distortion, not blurriness.I have no idea what this could be. I get my nutrients, protein, hydration, etc.I have been vegetarian for the past five years (ovo lacto). I dont do drugs, smoke anything, and very rarely drink. I am 19, 5'6 and weigh about 120 pounds.This isn't the first time Ive felt the dizziness (it isnt frequent either), but it has never been this bad before and the face numbing along with with the dizziness getting so bad my legs got weaker and weaker are definitely new. What do you think this could be?",
