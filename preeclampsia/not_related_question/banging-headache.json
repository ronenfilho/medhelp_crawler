            "answer": "How far along are you? Any swelling or dizziness? I was struggling with horrible headaches that would last days sometimes more than a week. This started at 26 weeks(i am now 35W4D). I didnt have much swelling but I got dizzy often. When I finally talked to my doctor, he checked my blood pressure again and discovered it was too high from normal. I think it was around 168/94. He was concerned for the risk of preeclampsia. I had to do blood work that day and had to go back two days later for an ultrasound to see the babies growth, fluid, and heart rate. All came back normal, but I have had constant high blood pressure since so I het tested weekly for preeclampsia and have an ultrasound done. Constant to severe headaches can be a sign of high blood pressure which could be dangerous. Best of luck to you! This is just my experience and yours could just be a pesky pregnancy symptom!",
