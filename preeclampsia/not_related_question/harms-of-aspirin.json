            "answer": "Hi Kelly! From what I've read, it increases the risk of placental separation. I'm sure it has to due with the thinning of the blood. Does tylenol work for you? I'm so skiddish after having mc due to placental separation, I would stay away from asprin if possible. Just my personal opinion. I'm not a dr, I just play one on tv, lol",

    "question": "I have terrible headaches daily and my Dr. said that he is okay with me taking aspirin upt to 20 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know the harms of aspirin in pregnancy? He didn't say how much or how often but I take 1-2 BC powders a day (eek). I can't function otherwise. On the package it just says consult a dr. if pregnant and do not use in last 3 months. My Dr. said something about not using it after 20 weeks because some kind of formation of a heart valve at that time. Thanks!\u00a0\u00a0I am 12w.5d",
