    "question": "Good morning ladies! So, today is my due date! :) yesterday evening, my ankles & feet doubled in size, and my legs started to swell. My fingers a little bit along with my face, and deicded to go to bed and if I was still swollen this morning, I'd call my doc. Well when I woke up, my feet, ankles and legs look the same if not even more swollen. But my face isn't and my fingers are just a tiny tiny bit. I googled it and it said the swelling should go away at night....",
