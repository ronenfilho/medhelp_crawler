AND also a ultrasound is very unaccurate late in pregnancy ESP with the weight of the baby. It can go up to two lbs both ways. good luck!I know id probably try my best to be induced ASAP with a 9 lb baby, I would never do an elective Csec just bc that doc would have issues for the rest of his life, if my baby was smaller then that.",

First off u/s can be off (I know first hand)\u00a0\u00a0and secondly I would refuse and ask for an induction if they want to monitor you so badly. I agree that even if you go to 40 weeks with a large baby you can still have a vaginal delivery, it happens all the time. You have the choice, they dont unless there is a medical reason they cant force you.Good luck!",

There's no medical reason to right now, baby's size is ONLY an estimate...my dr said u/s measurements for weight are just as good as putting your hands on your belly to see how big the baby is...in other words, NOT very accurate. They have to have your permission to do a c-section, they can't just make you. I'd tell them no, that you want to try vaginally first, and if you're not dilating or the baby gets stuck/you push for a long time and nothing happens THEN you'll discuss a c-section.",

I just can't say it enough- CONGRATS!!!StinaKaye- that is not a very helpful or uplifting story for someone asking for help for a natural birth rather than cesarean. Also women have been known to give birth to babies over 13-lbs vaginally when supported by a good labor team and especially if she is able to push in a position other than on her back in bed. And as you can see Neecy updated to say she did have her 9-lb baby vaginally and is very happy with her birth!",

There are a few reasons why they would suggest that, one being that your cervix is likely to tear, which can be very difficult to close up and you could lose a dangerous amount of blood. I would talk to your dr. and tell him that you don't want it. I'm sure that you can at least negotiate something that you would be more comfortable with. But you should trust your Dr. and if you don't, then you should get a new one. After all, they are the ones who went to school and have the degrees and the knowledge, not us.",
