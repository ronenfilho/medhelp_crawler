Yes, that is an idea to just have somebody over and direct them with the stuff you want done.Regarding the diapers, I was telling my husband he needs to go and get a few packs of Nr. 1's because we already a lot of 2's. I am on home bed rest for the 3rd week now (high risk of preeclampsia and refused hospitalization, now almost week 37 so almost there) and he came home yesterday evening from work really cute with some roses for me and 2 more packs of Nr. 2's :)",
