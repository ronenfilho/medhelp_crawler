            "answer": "i just failed the gd test. my doctor is a high risk maternal fetal medicine doctor so i think he has a good deal of experience with this. he says my risks are1. abnormally big babies that could require c-section(i am having twins)2. gd increases you risk for preeclampsia which often leads to early delivery( i have that already) preeclampsia causes the placenta to not function fully so your baby is not nourished as best it can be aside from other things.3. if you don't control your sugar your baby can be born with a dangerously low blood sugar level.4. it could become lifelong for you if uncontrolledi'm sure there is more. i was shell shocked and forgot to ask very much info.",
