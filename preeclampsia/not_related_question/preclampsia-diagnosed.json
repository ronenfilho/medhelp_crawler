            "answer": "I don't think they worry unless it's over 150/90 for 3 readings or more. You might be starting to get pregnancy induced hypertension which certainly could lead to preeclampsia, but they could treat that with meds and if it stays down with meds then usually you are okay. Is your next appt soon?",

            "answer": "This is my 2nd pregnancy with it and both times I've had bp over 140/90 on two consecutive readings at least a couple of hours apart, increased levels of proteins, swelling in hands face and feet, and blinded by white spots. The first time I had it severely and my right side under my rib also hurt really bad. But it was the swelling and bp the prompted my dr to investigate further. Without the protein you might still have gestational hypertension as the lady said above, so if you're worried get them to check your bp again. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Yikes! They should get back to you asap! Try not to worry as that will get your bp up higher. If it stays high like that, then you should probably go to the ER or an urgent care. If it's over 150 and they still haven't got back to you. Make sure both feet are on the floor when you take it and try to do it when everything is quiet and calm and you have an empty bladder. Switch arms and take it again, then wait 10 minutes and take it again. I have pregnancy hypertension and have to monitor mine too. Without my.medicine it gets into the 140's over 90's",
