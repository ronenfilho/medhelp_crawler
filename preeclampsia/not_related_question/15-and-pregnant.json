            "answer": "Discharge like that is normal during pregnancy. And an increase in it is normal as well. If you suspect that you are pregnant, you would more than likely wanna test sooner than 12 weeks because you need to be taking prenatals and getting the care you will need for you and your baby.",

            "answer": "I agree with the others, take a test now and if you can get one try a digital like clear blue which are very accurate (i got a positive early on) you want to make sure to get prenatal care now because being young you have a higher risk for complications like preeclampsia, preterm labor, and other things.take vitamins and folic acid (get it at the pharmacy it's with vitamins) and if you are NOT preggo then get on some birth control. it's so tough to have a baby young and if you can prevent it you should until your old enough to support yourself and the child :)",

            "answer": "definitely take another test prior to when you think you would be 12 weeks and if it's negative get to a doctor. a lot of early pregnancy symptoms are the same as menstrual.if you are pregnant....start reading as many baby books as possible, get started on prenatals and figure out what you and the father are going to do.if you're not pregnant...i would highly suggest b/c AND condoms or not having sex (birth control and condoms are not 100% effective. the only sure fire way of not getting pregnant is to not have sex) until you're financially stable and mentally mature enough to care for a baby. (i'm 25 with 21 month old twins and it's taxing on me....)",

I cant talk I am 17 and been pregnant twice I had a termination because I simply wasnt ready, living in a refuge and had an eating disorder, nd running from a domestic violence issue for the 6th time of my life, and also losing my boyfriend of 2 years (back togetther now) then had a miscarrige.
