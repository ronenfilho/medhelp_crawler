            "answer": "Hi,At this point, I suggest that you continue to observe your urine. Urinating very fast may cause bubbles to show. Also, some substances in the toilet bowl may react with the urine and cause bubbles. These are things to consider. At this point, I suggest that you should not be worrying unnecessarily. I understand that you are anxious about this however, it should be a relief that the test results are normal.Continue observing your urine's character. Note any change in color, odor, and amount. Also note for any changes with urinary patterns eg increase in urine frequency.",

If your symptoms continue much longer, you might want to consider setting up a doctor's appointment, especially if you think that an infection is a possiblity. I'll keep you updated and let you know if anything is diagnosed on my end.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you start feeling better soon. :)Take Care,Kelly",

            "answer": "My docs thought I had a terrible rare disease and if I had protein in my urine, then it would be possitive. No bubbles/fizz of any sort. Then all of a sudden I got BUBBLES...lots of them. I could hear them fizzing. Got so scared. Doc took another urine test and sent it out to the laboratory--no protein. All I had was just bubbles that were popping. My bubbles weren't foamy.My husband came home and had to pee. (this is so embarrising). Anyway, I asked if I can see his urine. He too had lots of bubbles. I still have bubbles for many months and no protein.But do keep an eye out for foaming and see if your bubbles pop and how fast they pop. If it takes a longgg time to pop, then go see your doc. But personally, I wouldn't worry about the bubbles. Make sure you drink 8 cups of water each day and check the color of your urine. If you don't drink water, then your urine might be darker. Even so, if the color is dark, go to the doctor. Relax. I know how you feel. I've been going through tons of scares myself for the past few months. Can hardly sleep or function because my mind is always on it. I'm not a doctor, but do go periodically to check your urine. It doesn't hurt. Oh..about the white color tissue..I had it for a bit and was told that it was most likely dead skin sluffing off.(think sluffing is spelt wrong). I might have had a little infection or whatever. Evenutally, it stopped. Keep an eye on it.",

            "answer": "Hi Obession and Lori707, when you mentioned no protein in your urine, did you get this result from routine urinalysis? If so, if the bubbles/foams continue, I suggest that you get a 24 hour urine collection done to detect protein volumn. Urinalysis dipsticks are not good at detecting all proteins. That means negative results doesnt rule out protein in urine completely. The 24 hour urine collection is far more reliable. talk to your doctor.",

But now I'm getting lots of sluffing to the point that when I first urinate in the morning, small globbs of white skin or muscos is showing up. I don't think I have IC because I don't fit all the symtons. Do I I have fit all the symtoms to have IC? Anyway, I'm on antibiotics but that's not working.I went searching for a urologist and the first appointment any doctor could give me is in a month from now. (that's a long time to be bent over with pain).I'm wondering what could be causing SO much sloffing. Also wondering if bladder cancer can cause that too.If someone out there has anything clue to the increase everday sloffing and pain, please post a comment. I'm kind of anxious.",
