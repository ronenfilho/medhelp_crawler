            "answer": "a blood test can detect a pregnancy as early as 5 days after ovulation. basically because it once you ovulate and the sperm and egg meet it takes about 5 days for the egg to implant itself and that is when the hcg hormone starts being produced.that being said....if you ovulated late it is possible that the blood test could have been wrong it just depends on when you ovulated.\u00a0\u00a0however after 11 years (i'm betting) it is unlikely that your tubes came untied.good luck to you, let us know what you find out.~nanci",

            "answer": "Subject: Pregnacy after tubal ligationTopic Area: Pregnancy - AbnormalForum: The Maternal and Child Health ForumQuestion Posted By: Tamm on Sunday, April 25, 1999Posted by Tamm on April 25, 1999 at 14:03:41I had a tubal ligation about 13 months ago..I recently went into see my dr with abnormal symtoms in my cycle ( server cramps, heavy bleeding large clots) He informed me that I was miscarring. I had blood work done that showed a high level of pregestrone, which confirmed his diagnosis. Could you please explain how this happened and if it could happen again?Thank youI found the article that I was looking at earlier on the net.\u00a0\u00a0I copied it and pasted it here. Let me know what you think and I will let u know what I find out. Thank you for your help I realy appriciated it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Posted by hfhs.md.rcs on April 26, 1999 at 23:51:24Dear Tamm:Tubal ligation has a known failure rate that is 1-3/1000 women in the first 5 years and 10/1000 women by 10 years.If the portion of the tube attached to the uterus unseals or the ends of the tube grow together, there is a pathway for sperm and egg to meet.Keywords: tubal ligation failureThis information is provided for education purpose and is not a medical consultation.

Almost 5 years to the day I was feeling really crummy, cramp,bleeding after my normal period. I went to the hospital and told them I had my tubes tied, routine was still to do a pregnacy test and low and behold I was pregnant. I had an ultra sound and it was NOT a tubal pregnancy but I did miscarry. No one can explain this either. It is very frustrating because I do want another baby, but everyone keeps telling me different things. The doctors can't even give me straight answers. Anyone else???????",

I took a EPT test and it came back poitive and then I went to the hospital a few days later due to cramping and they told me that I wasnt pregnant. Here it is Oct. I still havent had a period I have all the signs of being pregnant. I can even feel my uterus now its gotten hard like a brick and further up in my abdomen. But I still can not show a positive urine test. I did do some research on it and I learned when you have a tubal its best to do blood than urine becasue of some reason its harder to get a positive urine test. The problem im running into being that I dont have insurace that its hard for me to find anyone to do a blood test on me they tell that they cant to a blood pregnancy test because I have had a tubal. I have come to the point as to say I know my body well enough I have had 3 kids and I know in my own little way im pregnant so im just going ot wait until the baby comes. I am so frustrated with this situation. Its going to cost me well over 200 dollars just to get a blood test done if I can find someone to do it. I have been on the phone with several nurses around here in my area and they all tell me the same thing \"you have had a tubal you need blood done not urine.\"Im compleatly at a loss.",
