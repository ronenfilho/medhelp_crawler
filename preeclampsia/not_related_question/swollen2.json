            "answer": "I've been put in the hospital two weeks back to back\u00a0\u00a0due to me having high blood pressure and being swollen from head to toe pretty much how you are and had to do a total of three 24 hour urine test and I have preeclampsia...my last visit at the doctor's office my blood pressure was 170/110 and I was monitored for 24 in the hospital the most miserable thing ever and now I'm getting induced this Thursday because of all of this...you should notify your doctor and they'll go from there because you don't want to walk around like that and it turns out you have preeclampsia and everything gets worse, but they'll probably give you some type of medicine to control your blood pressure and stuff. I got my dosage increased and now I have to take it three times daily every eight hours and i was put on bed rest, also sleep and resting on you're left side REALLY helps, but you can switch sides whenever you get uncomfortable don't lay on your back because that make your baby lie on your main artery/vein and that decrease your blood flow and keep your feet elevated and I also found that keeping turn lights off and noise level to a minimum helps A LOT with the headaches",
