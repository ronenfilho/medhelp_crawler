Pain associated with preeclampsia is generally felt in the upper right quadrant of your abdomen (right below the breast) and in your shoulder. Chest pain sounds like you may be experiencing tachycardia especially since you have a heart murmur. If you don't want to be seen in the hospital tonight, you at least need to call your doctor.",

I suspected the swelling was getting a bit out of hand so I made a dr appt and my BP was 180/110, and I had protein in my urine so I had to be induced right away...however besides the swelling I really didnt feel sick, no headaches, no problems walking due to swelling, no vision problems. So personally I know you might not feel any different even if you do have preeclampsia, so just be checked out to make sure :)",
