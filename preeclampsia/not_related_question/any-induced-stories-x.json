            "answer": "I had a 2 day induction June 15th, they started cerdivil to help my cervix. When I went in I was 1cm, 50% and he was at a -3. They kept the cerdivil in for 12 hours and it didn't do anything. 8am on the 16th they took the cerdivil out and started me on pitocin. Around noon they broke my water, I was at a 3-4cm and 60-70% by then. After my water broke contractions got worse, they came to do an epidural around 730pm in which did NOT work at all. 8pm i started feeling pushy, nurse came in and I was at 9.5, they Dr wouldn't let me push because he didn't want me to tear my cervix, but in just a few contractions I was ready to push! I pushed for about 30 minute with the nurse, Dr came over and my son was out in 3-4 pushes! It was a VERY smooth and easy labor for me. Although it was long, I had no complications :) I would go through labor over and over again! I'm actually excited to go through it again in the future, even though the pain was crazy.",

Couple of hours later at 11:54a.m my little boy was born, best experience ever!!",
