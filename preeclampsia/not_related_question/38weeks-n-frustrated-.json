            "answer": "Just try to sit back, relax, and breathe. Everything will work out. Baby sounds healthy, like you said just stubborn. Definitly be straight forward with your doc about how you feel to and make sure there understanding any concerns you have and are taking them seriously. And as for all the other stuff.... just breathe momma, it'll work out!! Focus on positive things and try to do things to calm down like just watch a movie or take a drive, whatever calms you. Good luck!! And just take deep breaths!!!",

            "answer": "If you have vision changes with migraines, that's not a good thing but I don't know what it indicates. My doc office said if I even get those at the same time to go in. Otherwise the other symptoms seem like end of pregnancy regular stuff. Maybe get a second opinion from another doc in the same office? But if your monitoring is showing everything as fine then I really don't know. But SamN is right, just try to breathe and relax as much as possible.",
