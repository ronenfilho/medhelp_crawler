However, women with solid organ allografts have higher incidence of pregnancy complications like hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm delivery. Hypertension appears to be dependent on the type of immunosuppressive agents. The influence of pregnancy on the risk of rejection is poorly known on the basis of available data. Rejection rate appears to be at least similar to the nonpregnant population. In some cases, such as in liver transplant pregnant women, even higher as compared to the nonpregnant population. Maintaining appropriate blood levels of immunosuppressive drugs is currently recommended. Malformation rate in the offsprings of transplanted women appears to not be increased; long-term follow- up of children born to allograft recipients is necessary to investigate possible developmental, immunological, or oncological disorders. We followed 70 pregnancies after kidney transplantation and nine after liver transplantation. All recipients were maintained on immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy, except one mother who refused immunosuppression and experienced transplant rejection. Hypertension was the most frequent complication during pregnancy: in 23% of kidney transplanted mothers and in one out of nine liver transplant recipients. The only malformation observed in the newborns was the dislocation of the hip in the child of a kidney transplant recipient.",

            "answer": "Armenti VT, Daller JA, Constantinescu S, Silva P, Radomski JS, Moritz MJ, Gaughan WJ, McGrory CH, Coscia LA.Department of Surgery, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.Experience in the field of pregnancy posttransplantation has been gained through continued case reports, center reports, and registry data. The NTPR maintains an ongoing active database to study the safety of pregnancy and includes the outcomes of female transplant recipients as well as male recipients who father pregnancies. Analyses are ongoing and include long-term followup of recipients' graft status and of their offspring. For the most part, guidelines proposed in 1976 for counseling recipients remain applicable (30). While these counseling guidelines were formulated for kidney recipients, they may be extrapolated to other organ recipients as well. Organ-specific issues should also be considered in managing and counseling female transplant recipients. Recipients should be in general good health, and graft function should be stable and, ideally, rejection-free. There should be optimal control of comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes prior to conception. While the shortest safe interval from transplant to conception has not been established, 1 year is a reasonable milestone, given the prerequisites of stable, adequate graft function and maintenance-level immunosuppression. During pregnancy, maintenance-medication regimens should be continued with vigilant monitoring for effective drug levels and drug side effects with appropriate dose adjustment. These pregnancies are high-risk and require close maternal and fetal surveillance through coordinated care among maternal-fetal medicine specialists and transplant personnel. Of the live born reported to the NTPR, a higher incidence of structural malformations has been seen with MMF exposures during pregnancy when compared with the overall kidney transplant recipient offspring group. Three of the four defects included microtia (ear deformity), suggesting a pattern of malformations. However, live-born outcomes without structural malformations have also been noted in the MMF cohort. No structural defects have yet been reported with early pregnancy sirolimus exposures in a limited number of recipients evaluated. Limitations in assessing congenital malformation risk and MMF exposure include methodology and potential reporting bias, small sample size, and our inability to exclude other comorbid factors such as non-immunosuppressive drug effects or other susceptibilities in this population. It is incumbent upon transplant professionals to be aware of any additional risk to the fetus from immunosuppressive medications relative to the potential improvement in maternal graft function/survival conferred by each of these agents. Given the ongoing concerns with the newer immunosuppressive agents, clinicians are responsible for providing pregnancy counseling in all pre- and post-transplant recipients of childbearing age. Centers are encouraged to report all pregnancy exposures in transplant recipients to the NTPR. Future analyses from the NTPR are directed at potential effects of these newer immunosuppressive regimens, not only from immediate exposure but also from continued exposure that may occur from breastfeeding. As the registry study design allows for contact between registry staff and recipients and their health care providers, efforts are ongoing to analyze the long-term outcomes of parents and children. Continued close collaboration among specialists will help to better identify potential pregnancy risks in these populations, particularly as new immunosuppressive agents are developed. The fiftieth anniversary of the first post-transplant pregnancy (reported by Joseph Murray et al.) (31) will be in March 2008. With this important date approaching and with ongoing pregnancy issues concerning post-transplant pregnancy safety, this is an ideal time to raise awareness of the need for continued worldwide cooperation for data collection. Enhanced assessment of pregnancy safety is essential to the development of guidelines for counseling and management of pregnancy in the transplant population.PMID: 18368705 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE",

            "answer": "Management of pregnancy in transplant recipients.Sivaraman P.Department of Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore. pary_s***@****Transplantation offers the best prospect of pregnancy in fertile women with various types of end-stage organ disease. Based on data from the USA National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry, >70% of posttransplant pregnancies have a successful live birth. Greatest experience has been seen in transplants involving the kidney, followed by the liver and then heart. Most pregnancies do not affect graft function significantly but are associated with significant obstetric problems such as spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, low birthweight, intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia, etc. Cesarian section is required in 30% to 50% of patients, due to obstetric or maternal concerns. Neonatal death is rare, but 30% to 50% of live births have complications. Thus, management requires a multidisciplinary team. Similar data have been documented in developed Asian countries such as Japan and Singapore. Although fertility is restored early (/=1 year, if not 2 years, after transplantation before allowing pregnancy. Patients without evidence of graft dysfunction and hypertension are more likely to have successful outcomes. Acute rejections may occur but the incidence does not appear to be increased dramatically. Treatment should be to similar to that of nonpregnancy treatment. Further pregnancies may be considered in instances of good outcome for the graft, fetus, and mother. Significant experience and safety has been accumulated in treatment using cyclosporine, azathioprine, prednisolone, and tacrolimus. However, few data are available with regard to the newer immunosuppressants, such as mycophenolate mofetil, and thus these agents are not recommended. Most live births have normal growth and development. Although there is much information available on posttransplant pregnancy it is imperative that each center maintains its own registry of pregnancy and offspring outcomes.PMID: 15518723 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",
