Doctors get on my nerves sometimes because if a baby is on the exact dot they freak the mother out 11 ounces isn't that bad. If the baby was 8 or below then worry. BTW ultrasounds aren't always right. I was told my first son was going to be 3 pounds when born he was actually 4 lbs 12ozs\u00a0\u00a0I had preeclampsia so he had to come early. All babies are different and grow at different speeds.",
