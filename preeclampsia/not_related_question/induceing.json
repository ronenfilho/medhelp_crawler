            "answer": "Depends on the provider. In the US there is actually a ton of elective induction (whether the Dr pushes or or the parents do) which is really dangerous. Medical inductions have risks but usually the risks are balanced out by whatever caused you to decide to induce (preeclampsia, far overdue, etc). But to choose that risk with no medical reason is dangerous and selfish in my opinion.",

            "answer": "I'm getting induced at 39 weeks if she don't come before then for planning reasons. To make sure my son has somewhere to be considering his dad lives an hour away and can't exactly drive him there while in labor. And because my boyfriend works out of state 6 weeks at a time and my due date falls on the day before he leaves. He's here for the date of my induction. Call me selfish all you want but I'm doing it for reasons other then to just not be pregnant any more. I don't think I'll make it to 39 weeks anyway. I'm 29+2 weeks now, baby is down, pressure is hard and having alot of Braxton hicks and mucus loss.",
