            "answer": "Mines was a breeze i walked around some the next day at the hospital to see my baby in the nicu. And when i took him home it was so much better especially with the help of my husband. It was kinda hard for me to poop but i started back drinking coffee regularly so after a bit it was a normal flow. My bleeding only lasted about 3 to 4 weeks and not heavily blood either. The meds helped me a bunch also. Hope you feel better soon",

            "answer": "I also had a very tough recovery. I had a section for the same reason. Failure to thrive in Labour. I couldn't move for a few days and once I got home and the removed my staples my incision burst open and I had to call an ambulance. Lots of post hospital visits to take care of the incision and couldn't do much for almost 3 weeks. It is hard because you can't care for your baby the way you would like but it does get easier. Just know your baby will not remember and you have to take cars of you before you can take Cate of baby. I am onto my third baby and another c section and the recovery gets easier each time. Good luck momma.",

That's when my first tear dropped from the pain ..wheww. A few Motrin and I was up walking the halls again. I took it slow and recovered pretty .thankfully, i was still able to do everything for baby. The bleeding lasted about\u00a0\u00a02 weeks! Pray you heal fast! Rest up.",

            "answer": "Congrats on baby....I'm so sorry that your experience was a bad one...I've heard that it can go either way so I'm definitely thankful for my outcome. I had a csection with my first baby last summer and it was the.best experience ever and was a breeze despite what I was told to anticipate. I'm actually looking forward to my scheduled csection in February 2015. The first csection was decided after 19 hrs of unproductive labor. I was literally walking and tending to my baby (i kept her in the room with hubby and i) by 5am the.next morning (baby delivered at 5:11pm the day before) and I experienced no bleeding or spotting at all until my period returned months weeks later. I was initially worried that the csection would immobilize me since i'm short and super plus so I was already carrying a huge amount of body weight and belly even before baby however that didn't effect anything at all (I was shocked)...I barely even have a trace of a scar now and it healed super fast. Thankfully my body was functioning back to normal within days...I had the baby Thursday and by Monday I was back to business as usual since my husband went back to work that Tuesday for a 12 hr 7 day schedule for MONTHS and I had no other family to help. Now, I will say getting into the groove as a ftm wasn't too easy moving with baby but I pushed myself and it was easy by Wednesday morning...shucks...I had no choice.Congrats again on baby and I'm glad to hear that things have gotten better and you're able to enjoy baby...I can imagine that it must've been hard emotionally and physically.",

This time I've been assured they will want me to get up and move sooner and the cath will be removed sooner. I have no problem with the repeat c section I'm having on Wednesday.
