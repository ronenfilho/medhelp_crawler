    "question": "Since i was about 24 or 25 weeks pregnant i have been having undiagosed seizures. I haven't had a them in front of a doctor, only i have had tremors that occur after. Last night i had two and my mother in law called an ambulance. I have done an EEG and it came back normal, had anyone had this happen even though they still have seizures? Also since i am pregnant i can't have other tests. My fiance said that the seizures seem to be worsening. I've had about 6 in the last week. My father has grand mal sizures that were soley diagoned off of blood work alone, his are now regulated by medication. This took two years, my mother has simple partial seizures that were diagoned. I've only discussed this with my obgyn and ER doctors.",
