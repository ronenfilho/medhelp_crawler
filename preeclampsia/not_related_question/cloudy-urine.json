            "answer": "I know I have always had UTI's, I have a kidney problem that I was born with. So I get a UTI ALL THE TIME! So every time I had cloudy urine I went to the urologist lol, and sometimes I wouldn't have a UTI. So he told me there's lots of things that cause that and one of the most common things is excess um.. phosphate (sp?). Said it happens sometimes after eating a big meal or drinking milk. You can see if that's it by taking a sample of urine and dropping a bit of vinegar in it.. if it's phosphate then the urine will become clear immediately. If that's not it then it could be protein, have your doctor test you for preeclampsia as well.",

            "answer": "Honestly I dont think it has anything to do with milk, Im lactose intolerant and I don't drink milk at all, not even soy milk as it grosses me out. I even get the cloudy urine, but I only have it with FMU or if im dehydrated. I think it has to do with how concentrated your urine is, if there isnt a lot of water in it it remains cloudy, and when you drink lots of water it is usually clear and non cloudy.If it concearns you to much, you can always ask your doc, im sure lots of people have wondered the same thing, I just think mine gets like that because im dehydrated.",

    "question": "These past couple days my urine has been normal colored, [[cuz usually I'm dehydrated so it's a dark yellow]] but my urine has been cloudy??I'm not sure what this means, but I'm going for my gluecose screaning next friday to make sure\u00a0\u00a0I don't have gestational diabetes.They found a small amount of protein in my urine at my last doc's apt but the doc says that it could very well be just from being dehydrated cuz my pee was VERY dark that day.No matter how much water or milk, or juice I drink every day, I'm CONSTANTLY thirsty.I end up over hydrating myself atleast once a week because of the fact that I'm just so thirsty.I'm gunna talk to him when I see him at my next apt on the 3rd about that because this is getting rediculous.I get back to back uti's aswell.My mom said it could just be from having another uti, but I'm not having any other symptoms of having a uti?Does anyone know what might be going on?If I have G.D. I'm gunna like die because that means my boyfriend is gunna have to give me shots everyday and I'm SOOOOO not looking forward to that!!!",
