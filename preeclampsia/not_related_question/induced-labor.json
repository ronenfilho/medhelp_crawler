            "answer": "Yes! Please refuse it. I'm so tired of hearing people trying to make their babies come out before its time. Most people don't even wait till after their due dates. The longer the baby stays in there the better it is for the baby, cause it's still developing & has less chances of having problems such as breathing, heart, lungs, etc. The baby knows when it's ready. And it will let you know.",

            "answer": "With my first I was having contractions but not dilating on my due date. The doctor induced with patocin to see if it would help me dilate, they had no luck. They decided to manually break my water and that is when they found out that my sons head was pushing so hard on my cervix it had no space to dilate. Once they broke my water and\u00a0\u00a0helped to reposition the baby. Then within 4 hours I had my handsome boy. Other than the pressure from them moving the baby I don't feel that having been induced caused anything negative. Honestly after he was born they realized that if he would have stayed in any longer he could have been seriously ill due to having swallowed some fecal matter due to having a bowel movement prior to birth.-- I wish you the best with your baby.",
