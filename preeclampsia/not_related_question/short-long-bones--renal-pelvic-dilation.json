    "question": "I'm 30 years old and 21 weeks along with my first pregnancy (aside from 2 early miscarriages), and just when we thought we were in the \"all clear\", my doctor stops our ulatrasound, and tells my husband to put the camera down and have a seat.\u00a0\u00a0I heard him say the words short femur, short humerus, and kidney dilation, but when he said \"3 markers for Downs Syndrome\"... I just went numb.\u00a0\u00a0He measured the femur and humerus below the 2nd and 5th percentile, but I'm 5'9\" and my husband is 5'10\" (however both our maternal sides are very short).\u00a0\u00a0He said if he just saw the kidneys, he wouldn't be as concerned, being that this can be common, especially in boys.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to a specialist for a level II scan.At the level II scan today, the measurements of the long bones didn't change and we still saw the kidney issue.\u00a0\u00a0On the positive side (maybe), none of my measurements came back close to 21 weeks (symmetric baby)... all of it about a week and a half to almost 3 weeks behind.\u00a0\u00a0The head was in the 20th percentile, the highest percentile of any measurement.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure of my LMP dates as this was a planned pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0The nuchal fold was about 3 mm... good from what I read, and the heart, bowels, stomach, brain, sandal gap, nasal bone, etc. all looked good.\u00a0\u00a0At first I was elated.\u00a0\u00a0A mostly healthy - but small - baby!\u00a0\u00a0But with 3 markers... I was given a chance of downs of 1 in 10, much higher than the average 45 year old woman.\u00a0\u00a0That means 90% not Downs Syndrome, but what else could it be?Both my regular OB and this specialist did not suspect skeletal displaysia or IntraUterine Growth Restriction (IUGR).\u00a0\u00a0I feel like they're both focused on Downs, and as for any other possibility, they admittedly say they just don't know.I didn't think I'd do this, but I'm considering getting an Amnio for 2 reasons: 1) to prepare if it is Downs and 2) to keep the doctors focused on things they may be able to help in utero.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe they can even detect something else from an amnio?Anyone have a similar experience!?\u00a0\u00a0Any encouragement would really help!!!",
