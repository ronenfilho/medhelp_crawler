            "answer": "I would. I had a close friend close her baby bc the doctors were off a whole month on her due date. She went in at 35 wks knew she was in labor and they gave her a shot to stop it and sent her home. and nxt month at 40 wks her hubby came home from his deployment and they went for a check up and.found out their baby had died bc he was in the.womb too long. So personally I dont ever like.to go to 40 wks it scares the bones out of me. I'm having a repeat c section at 37 wks. My last one was at 36 due to low fluid. Getting induced really isn't a big deal. Some people say it hurts.more more but labor hurts no matter how you do it! Goodluck just be happy for a healthy little Bean!!",

            "answer": "Due to medical reasons (GD, high protein level and risk of preeclampsia) I was induced last week. They started me on cervidil 2 days before 39w and my son arrived when I was 38+6. It was almost heartbreaking to hear they wanted to induce me. I wanted to experience my water breaking on it's own and my son pick his birthday. I knew it had to be done and, in the end, it was the best decisions. My son weighed 8 pounds and 15 ounces at birth. Could you imagine how big he would have been in another week?! I probably would have had to have a c-section. Being induced has it's pros and cons: you can be prepared and everyone can be there. But, it is more of a chemical labor (the medicine is forcing your body into labor) and that pitocin is no joke (just being honest). So, I suggest weighing the good vs bad and go from there. Good luck and best wishes!",

            "answer": "I would do it. 39 weeks is long enough. I wish my dr would at least induce me at 40 if I haven't gone into labor. I'm 37 weeks now so I know I may have a few weeks left. But I had my son at 42 weeks and ended up having a 10 lb 3 oz baby (vaginally) and I do not want to go thru that again. Either the waiting (because I'm already miserable) or the delivery of a big baby. But they told me the dr won't induce unless I go past 42 weeks :( I guess it's different in NY because I have a friend in Texas who's dr told her they would induce her at 38 weeks and they've had that plan since she was like 30 weeks",

I thought it was a little werid to be picking my baby's b-day. My husband is happy with the whole schedule thing. My sister (who is pregnant with her 3rd) thinks it's a terrible thing to induce early. So what do you guys think?",
