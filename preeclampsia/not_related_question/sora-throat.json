Idk what to do to take some of the pain away. Since its not strep I basically got told to suck it up and wait till it goes away. I can barley open my mouth cause it hurts so bad and just breathing in air hurts bad :/ I tried honey but it just gave me bad heart burn. I'm 33 weeks, anyone have any advice? Thanks.",
