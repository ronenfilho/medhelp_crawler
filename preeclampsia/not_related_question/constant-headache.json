WOOOO that is a lot. he went more into detail about the water helping getting more oxygen(sp?) to your blood, and since our blood supply grows we need more water. (something like that) i hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Good morning.I think I would call my doc for 2 reasons...First, when I had bad headaches (I get menstrual migraines -- but pregnancy hormones also caused them for me)I didn't want to take even Tylenol.\u00a0\u00a0My doc said it was more stressful to be in pain so try the Tylenol -- I did and it just took the edge off.\u00a0\u00a0They did tell me if if didn't improve, they could give me something stronger that was safe to take when pregnant...I never got to that point though.Secondly, severe headaches can be a symptom of preeclampsia...there are many more sypmtoms of preeclampsia, and if you're being monitored, then BP, etc. would show if this was a concern...but I think I'd like to rule it out.BTW, I didn't see how far along you are...did I miss it?Lastly, dehydration also CAN be a cause of headaches and/or dizziness when pregnant.I prefer to be safe and check with the doc to rule out something more serious.LOL!!",
