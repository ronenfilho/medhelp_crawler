The only thing the surgeon said which made me think section when I spoke to her the other week was that they will not induce so if I get to 39 weeks and no sign of the cervix then its got to be a section due to risk of scar rupture from my first delivery in 2009. If I get anything else useful from the vbac consultation I'll let you know. That's if April isnt too late for you :-)",

I wanted a natural birth so bad, but the repeat c-section was such an amazing experience, my first c-section I was exhausted from being in labor for 12 hours prior, plus my hopes being crushed of a normal delivery and being terrified of recovery, the 2nd was so great. I think if you do choose a c-section you won't regret it at all, if I ever have another I'll be so anxious for my c-section experience, and I'm terrified of surgeries! Good luck either way! :)",

I wanted to try for a vbac very badly but as those two were only 14 months apart they wouldn't let me. They want the deliveries at least 18 months apart. As much as not having a vaginal delivery is a disappointment to me there is something to be said for a scheduled delivery. My mom was able to take vacation time to watch my son so my husband and I could be there for the. New arrival. Feb 2013 I had my 3rd csection which was the easiest delivery yet. Even better I have three perfect healthy babies. I wouldn't tell you what is right for you but repeat csections are not like emergent ones and the end results are the same healthy mom healthy baby.

Very scary! And I completely agree with kajfreak, they are so much different, emergency and planned, it's night and day. Definitely getting family members to take time off to help with recovery and with your other child is a great help.",
