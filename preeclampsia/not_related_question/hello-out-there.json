I know that 1 cm isn't really anything, but its better than nothing!!My BP was high so they are testing me for preeclampsia but so far have only found a lack of potassium, which I have to take supplements for.It feels like everyone is having their babies!! I'm hoping I go a little early!!",

Well I saw the other doc in the office today and had my group B strep test so I asked if he would check since he was already down there.My bp has been 90/50 consistently throughout this pregnancy and today it was 147/50, so I think they are testing becasue of the increase from last week.Why do you have to have a c-sec?",

            "answer": "Hey all... I wish I was in the hospital having my baby, but sadly I am not. I will be 37 weeks on Saturday and if I dont have my baby by the 14th my doctor will induce. My last appointment was on Tuesday the 27th and I was 1 cm dialiated and he didnt say if I was effaced... I am really hoping if I dont have my little man by the 14th he induces me on the 14th. I want to have my little man on or before Fathers Day... I was born on what was Fathers Day 1988. It would be really special....kennedy why do you have to have a c-section? Best wishes to all June Mommies and keep us posted.",
