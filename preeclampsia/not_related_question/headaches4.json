            "answer": "I'm 31 weeks & I've had headaches here and there throughout pregnancy.. but if I ever felt one coming on I'd make sure to drink lots of water (dehydration can cause headaches) & I've also used a warm rag on my head.. laying in the dark, on my left side, etc. probably helped too..also try to think about what you've eaten today.. I did notice I'd get them more often if I'd eaten chips that day, too many pickles, etc. obviously stuff with a little too much sodium for my body's preference I guess.. crazy how pregnancy changes everything!!!! lol please be mindful though, if they are TOO bad your blood pressure could be a problem. my BP has always been low (normal), so fortunately I think mine have been coming from what I eat.. which I've been trying to watch out for!",
