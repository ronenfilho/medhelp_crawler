Only when ur baby is born it has no choice but to go threw withdrawl as im sure ur not going to give nicotine to ur baby. If i were u i would start thinking about that and find a way to stop. Stopping cold turkey isnt good so youve done a great job so far! Now u just need to stop does 4 a day. I would seek help with ur medical dr. Im sure you dont want to be smoking when ur baby is born either its just getting over that very steep hump.",

And I have read evidence supporting cutting back being the best way as quitting cold turkey can be more dangerous for the baby. But just to share some information I read, smoking increases the chances of SIDS in a baby. I don't personally smoke and never have but I found this info while trying to find motivation to get my mother to quit. Good luck ladies! And deff. Congrats on cutting back!

Having a couple of cigarettes a day isbt going to kill you baby. Don't stress about the dramatic comments. Women in the\u00a0\u00a0last however many decades smoked like chimneys all through their pregnancies. Its only in recent years there been so much research and pressure to quit. Some people struggle to quit especially when its been a habit for so long. Just be proud of what you have achieved.",

And some are not so much. I've known a few people that miscarried during pregnancy due to smoking. Or a lot of health issues that came along with the baby after birth. If you can avoid putting your child at risk then you should. But the reality is every pregnant woman can't puff away on ciggs and get away with it. Anyway good luck everything.",

My sister smoked with her first baby and she did have colic but now we look back (she has 3 girls now) it was stomach reflux because all 3 girls had it and she didn't smoke with the other two. I feel bad smoking because it's not fair on my unborn baby but I get really stressed when I need a cig. I need willpower to quit and I need a lot of it. Plus my hubby smokes so it dosnt make it easy.",

            "answer": "I agree with jen_ortiz 100% :) never smoked in my life and never will! I cant stand the smell and it helps that my parents never smoked either. But i feel like a lot of women who do smoe will tell themselves anything to make them feel better. Maybe some of them are lucky and have healthy babies. Doesnt mean that the poor baby didnt go threw nicotine withdrawl when it was born and its certainly doesnt mean that they wont have issues later on in life. I just wish they wouldnt make it sound like its no big deal. Smoking while pregnant is basically the same as poping a cigarette in ur baby's mouth....only with pregnancy ur not physically doing it. Plus its a known fact that smoking increases chances for cancer, respiratory problems and much more. Anyway, im sure it must be hard to quit all together and decreasing the amount to 4cigarette a day is really good, but she shouldnt stop there. She should keep on working to stop completly because if that baby is born with a problem she will regret it the rest of her life.....i say keep on working dear! 4 is good but 0 is better! For both u, the baby, and all the people around! :)",

I smoked with my first 2 pregnancies and have healthy kids but I quit before ingot pregnant again. But there are women who do everything right during pregnancy and have unhealthy children. It's just the way it goes sometimes. But yeah, its not healthy to smoke period, but I'm so sick of people judging other women on this forum because they live different lifestyles. NUMBER1 if you've never smoked, your opinion is invalid. NUMBER 2 nobody's perfect and I'm sure if someone combed they everyone's life there will be something negative there. So congratulate the girls who are cutting back trying to get healthy for their children or keep your opinions to yourself. They came here for support not a medical history lecture. They obviously know its bad and I haven't seen anyone say smoking is good while pregnant because it's not but it's the baby steps toward getting healthy. I smoked since I was 12 years old and it's taken me this long to quit and I'm 24. Kudos to you moms who don't smoke and kudos to you moms who are cutting back for your babies",
