I lost a pound at my last appointment. But I found out the reason they are doing my growth follow up ultrasounds is to make sure that he doesn't get too big for me to deliver (because I am so small) so that was nice to learn lol",

Anyone else feel this way?I have put on 10 kilos (22 pounds) which is ok I suppose.I can't wait til we all have our babies!I hope everyone is doing great and just keep on keeping on! Not long to go now x",

I am starting to get scared, I actually sat by my four year old stepsons bed and cried last night... all because we were talking about his first day of preschool and He said he wasn't scared, was I ever scared of anything? I realized I am scared to death of giving birth. Spent thurs and fri in the hospital and almost didn't have time for fear they were gonna deliver me because of possible preeclampsia... but luckily i got to come home with my bunni still in the oven. I have had so many changes and so much stress I have not been able to take any birthing classes or anything... I feel woefully unprepared and it's like looking down a dark tunnel where you know there will be a ray of light at the end, but no idea what you will encounter along the way.....",

I have a 4D ultrasound scheduled for Friday and I am hopeing that they will tell be how big she is right now. I have had my other children at 36 weeks and both of them were actually big for 36 weeks. My first child was 5lbs 8 oz and my second child was 6lbs 12oz and rumor has it that the more children you have the bigger they get, so I am a little worried that Olivia is going to be really big. I have already gained about 23lbs with this pregnancy and with the other two I had only gained 20lbs at teh time I gave birth. So I am already bigger than I have ever been. I am just so ready for her to get here. I just want to hold her in my arms. But I just have a few more weeks to go.",
