            "answer": "It sounds to me as if the earlier due date is the accurate one and the later one is way off.I am surprised your doc's office did not measure baby and give you a due date based off of their first ultrasound, and disregard the one done in Germany due to discrepancies and possible inaccuracy. I would try not to worry about baby nor let the doctor's scare you. Especially with all of this going on and they may not even be right. Just watch your sugars, eat a careful diet, and stay on top of your water intake. Ecerything that males you feel Moe comfortable! Good luck mama!",

            "answer": "Ya i wouldn't go off of what the Dr in Germany said. Size of babies in us and europe differ greatly. My brother was born in Italy and my mom was told he was the biggest baby they had seen and he was 8lbs. So I would say the first day sounds more accurate based off of what u said, but I'm not a Dr or expert by any means. Good luck",

            "answer": "Im 37 weeks pregnant with a healthy girl. In my first ultrasound my baby was measuring almost 3 weeks bigger than she was supposed to be. So they changed my due date from April 9 to March 30th. Around 20 weeks we had to go see a specialist regarding something else (just a false alarm) anyways the specialist did measurements on her and told us that the original due date was more accurate. And now at 37 weeks shes measuring a week behind.This probably brings no comfort to you, but mistakes are made. And every baby grows differently. My doctors tell me the most important part is that she continues to grow. No matter what your baby will come when it wants, does not matter what your due date is. I wish you the best though! and i hope your husband your husband is home for your delivery!",

            "answer": "Does basing it off of your last period date add up to either of the due dates? I was told that after the first trimester, ultrasounds are less accurate because babies grow at different rates. I am 35 weeks tomorrow and my baby girl is measuring a week ahead. I would go with the earlier date since they are saying baby is measuring way ahead. Better for your husband to take leave early than miss the birth!",

In fact based off a chart he would still be measuring a little big.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just frustrated at the fact that the dates on my scans are off by three weeks, he's all of a sudden measuring really big, and I no longer know which due date is correct.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks seems like it would make a big difference...especially in the last trimester. But I'm definitely no expert.

    "question": "Sorry in advance for a long and possibly confusing post.First off, I'm 25 years old, ftm, and a military spouse. I'm also considered high risk due to being type 1 diabetic, so I get a lot of ultrasounds done.I found out I was pregnant while in Germany with my husband. Instead of giving me a EDD based off my last period, which would have been 5/13/15, he gives me one based off his first ultrasound because he says the babywas measuring too small to have been conceived that early. So at what he said was 7 weeks gestation I was given the EDD of 5/25/15.Now fast forward to December. My husband and I decided it was best if I stayed in the states once we returned home on leave due to lack of medical care for my diabetes. For the record my sugars were controlled, I just felt like I'd receive better care at home. So now I'm seeing a group of what I call regular OBs and one high risk OB who is in charge of checking growth and basically telling me if I'll go to my due date or not. From the start they could not figure out why the German OB gave me the due date he did. In fact the nurse at one time changed it to 5/13 but it was changed back pending getting his original ultrasounds, which i gave to one of the reg. OBs who just did glance at them then changed my date back to 5/25 based off measuring my stomach...or so I thought.Now on to this past Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0By this point I have had 2 growth ultrasounds showing the baby is perfect...until Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a03 weeks after my last one he is all of a sudden measuring way too big (over 4 pounds) and the doctor is explaining all the risk factors including still birth because of this. Now again, my sugars are controlled...so they should not be effecting the babies growth. So by this point I'm emotional and worried. I cry the whole way home. Later that night however, while looking at the previous ultrasound from 3 weeks before, I realize the dates don't match. The first ultrasound says I'm 28 weeks along. The one from Tuesday, again 3 weeks later,\u00a0\u00a0says I'm only 29w1d. Please tell me how this is possible? So I pull out the calendar and do some calculations. Turns out, at least as far as I can figure,\u00a0\u00a0they were using the due date of 5/13/15 for my first 2 growth ultrasounds. And 5/25 for this last one, where he is all of a sudden measuring really big.So now here is my problem.\u00a0\u00a0The way I see it, either 5/25 is correct and my baby has been measuring big this whole time and no one seemed to notice or they have had my due date wrong this whole time and it should be 5/13. I just find it weird that he was measuring perfect the whole time until my \"corrected\" due date was used.So could my due date really have been wrong this whole time? I understand that its just an estimate but 3 weeks is a lot to be off by. Not to mention my husband is basing his leave off my due date so he can be here when the baby is born. Has anyone else had this problem...especially this late in the pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0I plan on calling the doctor today to make them aware, its 4am here btw. I'm just so confused and frustrated and worried that I cant sleep. If you've actually read this far thank you. And any input would be greatly appreciated.",
