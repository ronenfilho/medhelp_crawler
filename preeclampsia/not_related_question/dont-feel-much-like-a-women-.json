Okay, this is going to sound disgusting, but I've read somewhere about lions, and sometimes the females couldn't give birth to their cubs, so the father would rip them out of the mothers belly with tooth and claw. The mothers that lived and healed took care of their young just the same.",

My water broke at 34 weeks so they started me on pitocin being that labor never started and I didn't dilate at all I was already 2 cm before my water breaking. My daughter didn't move an inch. The doctor advised me that it was probably best to get a c section bc it didn't I didn't dilate at all with pitocin.Think about it this way, your daughter had to get out some kinda way. Whether you pushed her out or not that doesn't make you any less of a mom/woman. Whenever you have another child you can always consider having a vbac!",

You carried that baby for 10 months you dealt with the contractions and all the other pain that came with it. Now if carrying a baby in your womb for 10 months an giving birth to it no matter how it comes out is not a woman then idk what is. Not everybody is the same just remember that.",

    "question": "Any ftm out there that had a cesarean??\u00a0\u00a0This is my first child had her about 2 months ago. She was born at 38 wks because I had preeclamsia. went to hospital and was started with pitocin, my water broke hours later and was starting to dialet(spell check) I thought I was going to be able to give birth vaginally since everything was going smooth, and so did my doctor.. but after about 3 hrs of no difference made stuck at 8 cm my doctor said it was time, she had to be born. So I had the cesarean :( .. sometimes I feel like I'm not a women because I didn't give birth to my baby like all women are supposed to.. i know it's not true but I can't help it. And sometimes I don't even feel like a mother :'( actually I don't at all, could it be because of this? anybody else feeling like this?",
