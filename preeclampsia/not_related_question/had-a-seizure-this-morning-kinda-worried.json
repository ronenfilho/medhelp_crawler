            "answer": "So I am curious on a few things momma. Was your husband home with you while you were seizing? I am only asking because in your original post you said he was home and laying with you, then in your comment you said you were going to go to the doc as soon as your hubby got home. Sorry just confused. It sounds like a partial seizure. Were you conscious while seizing? If so, chances are it was a partial and not a grand mal seizure. Whatever type of seizure it is very important it gets figured out. If it were me I'd be soooo freaked so good job being calm! Also, back to the husband thing. I may just be confused because we may be in different time zones. It's 6:50am here lol\u00a0\u00a0I wish your OB was a little more concerned though. I know my OB would be very concerned if it were me. Hope all is well Momma!! Best of wishes! Hopefully whatever is wrong is figured out!",

I'm waiting for him to come home this morning. Haha. And I cried my eyes out after I stopped seizing so much (I continued to shake for the next half hour), so I think I just kinda freaked out and then slept for a while to calm down. :)I don't think it was passing out though. I typically start to feel very empty and uncoordinated and unable to breathe right before I pass out. I was totally fine when I was going to sleep at first.I haven't been eating too well lately due to some pretty bad nausea, though. That kinda leads me to believe it was low blood sugar. It really is no fun being hypoglycemic and unable to eat. :p",

It would just drop out of no where! I had to take sugar pills! I wasn't sure if it was my work schedule or how often I was eating. I was working 12 hour shifts pretty much daily for months on end and it was night shift. So I wasn't sleeping and wasn't eating properly. Lol but, enough with my story, I just hope they get it figured out for you! Seizures are scary enough\u00a0\u00a0but being pregnant while having them tops it. First one you've ever had?

A week ago I knocked on this poor elderly woman's door at 2 am because I thought it was my own apartment and got locked out while taking our dog for a walk! So embarrassing!I used to keep candy in my purse just in case I got dizzy. But it's been a while since my hypoglycemia has been bad, mostly because I eat frequently. Unfortunately, that's not always possible during pregnancy. The sugar pills are a good idea! I should probably carry some with me from now on... :)",
