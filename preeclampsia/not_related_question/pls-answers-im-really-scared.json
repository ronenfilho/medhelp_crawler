            "answer": "I'm sorry you have to go through that and I know how scarry it can be. About 2 weeks after I gave birth (5/25/12) I checked my blood pressure and it checked for heart rate. One day it was 185/90 and my heart rate was at about 45. I was so scared and was about to drive to the hospital, but decided to call my doctor. He said to just relax and that it could be something I was worried about. I kept feeling my heart pounding, but at a slow rate. I had my doctor's appointment a few days later and my bp was just a little high and my rate was back to normal. They didn't have to check my heart or anything but everything is back to normal. Is there a possibility that you can just be experiencing a panic attack? Sometimes also, if you have any swelling, my doctor said it can cause bp to go up and heart rate to go down. Keep us updated!! I really want to know what doctor's say about your situation.",

            "answer": "Just went to see my OB and we ruled out the preclampsia because my chest xray was normal and i dont have protein in my urine. My blood count is still low by 25% , blood sugar is low, and im anemic. Blood pressure was much better at 129/75 but heart rate was 50. Dr said my heart rate can be low because of adjusting to my levels that are low right now. They also want me to wear a monitor at home for 24hrs if my heart continues to be low. Im hoping it goes back to normal because feeling like this is hard to take care of 3 kids.",

            "answer": "I've heard that anemia can cause the heart to change rythem... U don't know how true that is, but if it's b/c of the anemia then you should make a chicken soup (with a lot of veggies) and drink the broth. When my mom had my sister her anemia levels were very low and within a week they were back to normal. She did get preeclampsia (after birth) and she ended up in the hospital for about 2 weeks!!! Then when she was released she hemoraged and had to go bsack so it is very important you get your levels back up.",
