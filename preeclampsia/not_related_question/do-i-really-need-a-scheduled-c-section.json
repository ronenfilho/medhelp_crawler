            "answer": "I see your point....I never want another c-section but my first one was becasue of an emergency (cord around the baby's neck 6 times). But if I have any more, I want to have the baby naturally. However, I am not sure it will ever happen because my first c-section was a very wide cut because they didn't want any pressure around his head when they pulled him out. It was a horrible experience and it really irritates me when people ask for them....if babies were meant to be born via c-section, then they would be!!!",

            "answer": "i also can't believe anyone would elect to do a c-section. i was traumatized by it as well, and thought i would never do it again. of course, memories fade with time. i still get kinda upset everytime i look at that scar. it bothers me that i was cut through 3 layers. of course it was worth it, but if i often wish i didn't have to have one. i had one 4 weeks early due to preeclampsia. my dr said if we induced that early, i would most likely need a c-sec anyways, because the baby and my body were no where near ready. it turned out to be a good call- i was so sick by then, i couldn't even stay awake while waiting for the c-sec. my dr. does not do vbac due to risks, so i will have to have another. i dread the recovery.its remarkable that more than half of the people i know who had babies recently had to have c-sections. with one coworker they discovered placenta previa and she would have bled to death. with another the baby was thought to have serious problems. another also had severe preeclampsia. another had an almost 10 lb baby that just wouldn't fit after going through labor. another's baby's heartrate plummeted during labor because the cord was wrapped around her neck.\u00a0\u00a0i hated my c-sec, but i am very greatful, since if it were not available, both my baby and i would have been at risk of dying. same for those other cases.",

    "question": "I have one son who was in the posterior position while trying to deliver him. I was in labor for 4 days and hardly dialated and then when I did pushed for one hour while the dr. tried to turn him but he just wasn't coming and his heart rate started to decrease and i ran a temp and my blood pressure went way down so they took him c-section. This time around I asked my dr. if I could go naturally because I was under the assumption that it was just because Jace was turned the wrong way he wouldn't fit through. The Dr. said that that wasn't all, that my hip structure/or pelvis structure was too small to push him through and 90% chance that would happen again. I don't want ot take the risk of the baby getting hurt so c-section is fine with me but it seemed like he was so quick to say that I would have to have another one. Also how come he didn't tell me that before but all of a sudden he remembers it 1 1/2 years later? You just hear of so many people having c-sections now days you wonder if they all really need them.",
