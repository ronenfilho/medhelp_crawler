The nurse quickly informed her that I saw a completely different doctor. I also snapped that I wasnt having a government baby.Yesterday, while I was walking to the nurse after she called my name, another lady whispered how I was another teenage unwed mom. I was contracting and not feeling well so I turned around and asked her in front of the busy lobby if she would like to see my drivers license and my wedding band I got 5 years ago. She looked down in humiliation real quick. I'm 27 years old, not 14! Not my fault the Lord made me 4' 10\"",

When at that point I hadn't even started shopping for baby stuff. Also I hate it when everyone tells me what day to have the baby on or what day not to like I have any control over when I go into labor I hate hearing (if you go into labor on or around my birthday I am going to be so mad at you)",
