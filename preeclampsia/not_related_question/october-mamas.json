            "answer": "I just had my baby I was due October 8 but I had him September 12. I got induced the night of September 10 due to preeclampsia. They gave me pitocin and a balloon cathedar to put in my cervix to try and dilate me more. I spent like 30 hours having contractions brought on by the pitocin but I got stuck at 5 cm dilated and wasn't progressing. At about 9 am on the 12th my baby started to have distressed heart tones and they decided to do an emergency c section on me. I had my baby at 11 48 am. And he was perfect 6lb 11oz even though he was 4 weeks early",
