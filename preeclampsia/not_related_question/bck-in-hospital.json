I came in that afternoon (I was getting married to my now exhusband lol so they let us wait til after we were done celebrating) my BP was through the roof, they admitted me for a 48 BP and urine watch (for protein) my BP just kept getting higher and higher and he said my kidneys were failing, they hooked me up to a monitor for baby and found his heartbeat was very low which they said meant he was in some distress. So they came in 48 hrs later and said \"Doing the C-Section tonight around 6!\" I was only 36 weeks so mine was an emergency. For your little bundle comes now they'll be just fine :) I wouldn't worry too much you're far enough along there shouldn't be any complications! Good luck girly!!",
