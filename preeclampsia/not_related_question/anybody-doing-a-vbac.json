I would change my Dr but I really really like him and trust him..so I'm just gonna get another csection and just get it over with I guess. He didn't actually give me a medical reason as to why he wouldn't. He just said \"We don't do those. It's too much of a risk.\" i didn't even know they allowed people to do that until I told my mom about it. She had 2 csections and then 2 vbacs! She said the pain from delivering naturally (without epidural) was no where near the pain from a csection. My csection hurt for like a week, so I'm not that scared..I just wish I could try to push her out! Are you excited about the vbac??!",

            "answer": "I am very excited. I felt so cheated when i delivered my son. He was an emergency c section due to preeclampsia so i never even got to go into labor at all. My c section wasn't bad at all but i just want to experience natural child birth. Even if it ends in a c section i just want to try.Im a little nervous though. Not going to lie. I have heard stories from other people that the contractions are centered around the c section scar which makes it feel like it is going to rupture. I don't have anything to compare it to since i have never experienced contractions before so it sort of freaks me out.My due date is Dec 19 which is the day of fall finals and spring semester for college starts back up Jan 13. I am hoping i have a successful vbac because i don't think 4weeks is enough time to fully heal from a c section before i jump back in to school.",

            "answer": "Ooooo yeah that's gonna be hard to get back into school that quickly! I understand about feeling cheated. My friends who have pushed their babies out act like they are powerful..and like my csection was no big deal. I don't let it get to me cause they have nooo idea lol. My son was crowning, but his shoulders were waaay too wide for me to pass. I got that far with no pain meds =) It's definitely a crazy experience, i really hope you get to do it! I have a pretty high pain tolerance so the contractions didn't bother me too much until they were lapping over each other (while pushing). But even then it was doable =)",
