So my OB did a csection other wise I was going to die and the high risk was gonna let me. What good are u to ur baby dead. She was fully healthy and breathing on her own she just needed to gain two pounds before she could come home. But deff don't rule out a csection cuz it may save ur life. I was just like you. Now I'm on my second baby and all going good there just watching me very close cuz I was extreamly healthy and it came from nowhere the first time. And they said if it keeps going this way I can have him naturally.",

As a matter of fact- if you get induced then you're more likely to need one than if you're not induced. I know that there's probably plenty of women on here that have been induced with no complications but I'm just putting the facts on the table for you. And don't be scared about the c-section. A lot of my friends have had one and most of them prefer it to a vaginal birth.",

It is better to keep the baby in as long as possible but like you said if she comes earlier, there isn't much you can do. But even at full term people ask me if I'm scared and in 37 weeks with baby #5. I think sometimes people who haven't had kids of their own don't know what to say so they ask are you scared. Either way you'll do fine. Best of luck.",

Its labor.... yea its gunna hurt but so theres nothing to be scared about :p its not like there is something wrong.... even if she comes early more than likely by now she will be fine and able to breath on her own especialy with thoes steroid shots. If not she may have to be in the incubator for acouple days but really theres nothing to be scared about. Im a first time mom and i have no fear and want it natural. Only thing im scared of is csection and i will refuse it, they will induce me if anything... they are not touching me with a knife unless my baby CAN NOT come out.
