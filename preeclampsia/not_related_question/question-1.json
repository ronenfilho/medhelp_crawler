            "answer": "High bp is a main sign of pre eclampsia. I have it. Having high bp means the doctor will normally induce early because it can be harmful to the baby. Im 36 weeks as well. We will talk about inducing once i make it to full term next week. Your doctor should recommend you be on bed rest if your bp is a problem. Moving around and doing stuff will increase your bp. The best thing to do to keep it down is to relax as much as possible. Stay in bed if you can and keep your feet up.",
