            "answer": "Nope I sure wouldn't let him go. Not being that close and you could have that baby any day now.My husband asked If he could go on a fishing trip with his job for 3 days. I told him no and gave him a good explanation. I explained I'm pregnant and I need you here because anything can happen and I won't be able to do it alone without you. I've had 3 other pregnancies 2 were miscarriages and my 3rd pregnancy I had to be induced at 35 weeks because of preeclampsia. So knowing my history it's best that he wait until after the baby is born to plan any away trips.Plus from what I've read a man is to leave his parents and cleave to his wife. She shouldn't be disrespecting her grandchild his child and he should want to protect you both from her. My husband doesn't visit his mother often because of the way she treats me. Even after 5 years.I wish you luck and If it's possible. Sit down with her and try to sort the problems out. And If she's not willing then she needs to stay away because she is a burden to your family (your husband/fiance and child). Tell her you forgive her and ask her to accept your apology. There is a new life and for the sake of that child's life y'all need to figure something out. My husband's mother didn't accept anything and doesn't care. But sometimes it works to talk things out.",
