            "answer": "My sister had a vbac because the c section was an emergency one due to preeclampsia. She had a successful vbac and then another natural delivery later. If there's no medical reason to repeat a section (like breech or big head baby or placenta previa), healing is normally a lot better with vbac. A tip though, if you want a successful vbac, you need a Dr who wants it to happen.",

My doctor aaid i can wait and hope i eventually go into labor, but if i dont go on my own theyll do a csection. My husband starts a new job, and wont be home much once he does, so were thinking we should just take the csectio. Now instead of waiting and me ending up home alone right after surgery....",
