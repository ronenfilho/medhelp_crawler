            "answer": "They won't send you home after your water breaks. It is very easy to get an infection once your water is broken, and you could be dialated some without knowing it, even without contractions. It is always better to be safe.",

            "answer": "If your water breaks then you need to go to the hospital right away. Most women's water doesn't break until their contractions are already 5 minutes apart though. My friend had already been in the hospital for about 5 hours and her contactions were back to back before her water broke.",

            "answer": "My water broke without contractions. I was advisedto head in when I called the Dr. We took our time and husband took a shower. I got there about 2 hrs later and contractions were finally just starting. They did give me pitocin right away also to get it moving since I was barely dialated.",

            "answer": "I didn't go anywhere until more than 12 hours after my water broke. I stayed at home with my husband, my mom came by after several hours, we chilled out and counted and timed contractions and headed to the birthing center when they got serious. I was in contact with my midwives during that long day, they knew my water had broken and labor had started, they said there was absolutely no reason to rush. The nursing staff wanted to start an IV for antibiotics when I got admitted but the midwife who delivered my son said there was no reason to do so if I wasn't symptomatic of having an infection.Some facilities and some doctors are extremely overcautious. There wasn't any need for me to be monitored from the first moments of labor. I was just fine at home on my couch with a midwife just a phone call away.Exceptions obviously would be for women who are at high risk of birthing complications. Someone positive for Group B strep, for example, or someone with marginal placenta previa or clotting disorders or preeclampsia. Closer monitoring is totally warranted in those situations. But it's not necessary for everyone. Talk to your provider and see what your specific needs are. The hospital's policy may be to head in immediately no matter what, but your doctor or midwife may very well have a more reasonable and liberal policy regarding making informed choices about your care.",

            "answer": "Naah, I wouldn't expect so. Group B strep is a different animal entirely in that it can actually be dangerous to your baby... I don't think those other infections would necessarily mean an immediate infusion of IV antibiotics. But I can't say whether your doctor would agree.",
