            "answer": "Yeah your doctor would know best. If you don't have gestational diabetes and haven't had high blood pressure, fast weight gain, or protein in your urine (risks for preeclampsia) you will likely deliver around or after your due date. I was 25 with my first and I went 40+6. You can ask your doctor about a scheduled induction or c section if you really want but I recommend just going naturally if you can. If he came for 2-4 days before your due date that might be the best bet.",
