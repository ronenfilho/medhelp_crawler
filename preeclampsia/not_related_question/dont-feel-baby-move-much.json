            "answer": "Less movement along with really itchy skin would cause me some concern. My cousin went to the hospital 2 months ago because she couldnt sleep due to her itching so bad. She went to the ER to find out that she had SEVERE preeclampsia and they had to take the baby via c-section at 31 weeks preggo. Baby is now home but did have to be in the NICU for 4 weeks.Better to be safe than sorry. Get checked out hun.",

            "answer": "I actually went to L&D on Friday due to lack of movement. I was only there for about an hour, cause when they hooked me up to the monitors my little guy started going CRAZY lol! But they told me that we did the right thing by coming in... they said most of the time its just a lazy baby, but every once in a while it can be something more and if you come in they are able to intervene. As far as the itching, I have no clue, I know there are several things that can cause itching in pregnacy... is there a rash?? I know that PUPPS is a pregnancy rash that can itch like crazy but doesnt harm the baby, and then as Lance06 said... preelcampsia is also a more serious possiblitiy. It is always better to at least call your Dr when in doubt. Good Luck hun!",
