            "answer": "I was a week overdue. Was totally fine. No dilation or effacement. No pain. One night before bed my lower back was hurting. I thought oh again, i didnt even have a hard day. Took some Tylenol and went off to bed. Tossed and turned because the low throbbing wouldn't go away. Then I got super hot like I had a fever and felt sick. I went to the bathroom and threw up my guts then got diarrhea. This was all happening at the same time. I stripped down. So there I was, a naked fat buddah sitting on the toilet throwing cold water on me. Pooping like I had the plague and leaning over to the sink and vomiting all at once. You can imagine sight! About ten minutes later I finished and when I went to clean up I was bleeding (show). So I called l&d and told them I was coming in. Had my baby about 45 minutes later. Lucky I got to the hospital on time because she practically fell out and the pain was like nothing I had experienced in my life.",

            "answer": "Of my 3 pregnancies I've only gone into labour once and it was at our wedding lol...I was 37 weeks and didn't notice a thing except needing to go toilet ALL the time. We said our vows and had a few photos done then on the way to the reception hall I felt a weird period like cramp and asked my sister what it could be, she just looked at me blank and said see what happens. By the time we sat down at the reception my contractions were coming every 3 or so minutes. We left the party and went straight to hospital and I was 4cm dilated by the time we got there so they kept me in....it was nearly 8pm. Our first daughter was born naturally without drugs or help at 1.28am the following morning and we were home by 6am cause we had guests and family from overseas that travelled for the wedding waiting. It was such a rush and so unexpected to be that early but we'll never forget that day, we had waited 10 years to have our first due to recurrent miscarriage and after losing 8 we happily got our first beautiful baby and the best wedding present anyone could ever ask for.",

            "answer": "I went into premature labor at 29 weeks but the drs were able to stop it. Then at 31 weeks they decided to induce because of complications. I had preeclampsia and several other health issues. They dilated me to four cm with a Foley cath and the, started me on pitocin. I had already been having pretty strong contractions for a couple weeks but when I was in labor it wasn't the contractions that bothered me. I could breathe through those (I didn't want an epidural plus I have a supposed allergy to the \"caine\" drugs) but what was extremely difficult for me was that I was shaking uncontrollably. Not seizing or anything but my legs especially just wouldn't stop...like standing outside in 20 below shivering uncontrollably. They broke my water while I was still four cm but then my son's heartrate started dropping with every contraction. I was probably in labor about six hours when they decided on an emergency csection. I had to be put under due to the allergy but the surgeon said my son came out screaming. He didn't have to be put on oxygen, praise the Lord. I only got to see him about five minutes in recovery before they transported him to the NICU at another hospital.",

I just had a feeling of sudden pressure and it felt a lot like a bubble popping, but wasn't at all painful. However the last next to me did not appreciate wet shoes. My second pregnancy was induced at 31 weeks. Twins and one of the placentas had come partially detached. And my third also 31 weeks. My hubby woke me upset BC he thought I had peed on him while sleeping. Turns out my water had broken.",

            "answer": "With my first I had mild cramping and went to the hospital and ended up staying because my water bag was bulging. I walked the halls for hours and finally had the baby after 30 hours of labor. I hate hospitals though so i was stressed. With my second I woke up in the middle of the night with cramping and some bleeding (normal amount). I had the baby 8 hours later. Contractions never got closer than 3 min apart for my second birth. I don't remember much about my first birth because I was so stressed and ended up with an epidural and slept for several hours. Both my babies were born a few days before their due date. Full term though. And I had no interventions with either of them (thankfully) aside from the epidural with my first.",
