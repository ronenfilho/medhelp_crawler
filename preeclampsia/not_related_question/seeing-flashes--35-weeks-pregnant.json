    "question": "i'm 35 weeks pregnant and have been seeing flashes of light a few times a day, all I can find on google is eye disorders, I think this is an oxygen thing. I take deep breaths until they go away. It happens almost everytime I twist to reverse the car. You know they say not to lay on your back because it cuts off oxygen but I wonder if my babe is postioned to hit that vital something when I am sitting and twist, cause it happens when I'm giving my girls a bath. Then again, it happens occasionaly for no reason at times it seems. Could this be happening because at night I often wake up and find myself lying flat on my back. Maybe a lingering effect of lacking oxygen at night. Anyone?",
