            "answer": "In the beginning I had bad depression, I think mostly from all the hormonal changes. It got better around the start of the second trimester. But I'm 29 weeks now and I feel very depressed again. My relationship with my fianc\u00e9 is not going well and he is not the compassionate type at all. I feel alot of guilt because I'm not happy or excited about having this baby. I was a single mother from the time my son was 2 months old until I met my fianc\u00e9 and my son was six years old. It was hard but worth it of course. However I never would want to do it again especially with two kids and its starting to look like that's the path I might be heading down after my baby is born. I know a relationship shouldn't stop the happiness of becoming a mother again but I know how hard it was doing it alone last time and I don't want to do that again. I had no doubts about my fianc\u00e9 until I got pregnant and saw how selfish he really is. It's like he waited to be a jerk until he thought I was trapped and couldn't leave. I feel like he tricked me. I feel really\u00a0\u00a0down and hopeless. Nothing I do makes me feel better. Nowhere I go makes me feel at peace. And nobody I talk to really comforts me. I wish I could just sleep all day and night but I'm so uncomfortable I can't even sleep at night. And I have my 9 year old who needs me",
