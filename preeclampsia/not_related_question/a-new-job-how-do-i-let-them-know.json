When I interviewed for it I was only 9 weeks, I hadn't even told family yet!I was 20 weeks on my first day and not really showing yet, but it was a relief to start and have them know so they could plan for maternity fill in position to cover me straight away. I never explained whether I knew I was pregnant or not at the interview, as i have every right to this job just like everyone else who applied and interviewed... Unfortunately managers find it an inconvenience that we want to start our families. Well done on being the best applicant!!",
