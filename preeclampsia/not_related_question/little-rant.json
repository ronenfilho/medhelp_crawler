But i have come to realize that trying to force your baby out before its time can cause problems. So im doing just what you are...im keeping the process going without actually forcing it...like staying active and lots of sex. Lol",

            "answer": "I agree. I'm surprised myself. You want the baby developing inside for as long as possible. Now that being said-I have issues & will be having a Csection but not a day before 39wks. Unless he comes early my last two babies arrived 2+wks early. So I'm nervous if I'll make it to the scheduled C. I was induced w baby 1, my water had broke & I wasn't dilated so they wanted me on pitocin to get labor going. What people don't realize how painful induction is. It's very very hard & painful. Even if your wanting an epidural that doesn't always come when U want/need it. My girlfriend was induced @ 42wks & didn't get an epi for 8 hrs bcuz the hospital was too busy to get to her. & being induced doesn't make the baby arrive any faster once it's started.-another gf was induced & on pitocin for 37hrs she never dilated past 4 & ended up w a C.",
