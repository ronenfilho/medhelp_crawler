            "answer": "Hmm I guess that makes sense cuz I was born premature 2 months early weighing only 4lbs and that could explain why I had my first daughter at 36wks and my second daughter was born at 37wks. The only issue I ran into was that my first daughter suffered from jaundice but other then that was healthy and my second daughter was born under weight. I never did even make it close to a full 40wks and because of that I assume this baby will be born early as well. In any case there has been need for concern cuz premature babies can have immature lungs among other things but the doctors can detect that. So I wouldn't worry too much. You and your baby will be healthy and happy \u263a.",

            "answer": "A high percentage of premature births are caused by poor diet (families do tend to eat similar diets also). Do some research on your own most doctors are not good at preventive stuff just fixing the end problem. Also to keep checking your ceervix only irritates it more and increases it chance of dilation early. Eat good, drink lots of water, take it easy (i.e. no heavy lifting, etc) and tell your doctor you do mot want any more vag exams. They are not needed. Expect the best, bu tree also prepare in case you do go early.",
