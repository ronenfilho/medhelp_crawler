            "answer": "Does your doctor's office have an on-call doctor that can be paged when no one is in the office or a nurse you could talk with?\u00a0\u00a0I think it would be a good idea to have it checked.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying you should panic but definitely have it checked out to make sure everything's okay.Here's some info from the March of Dimes website-A systolic reading of 140 or higher, or a diastolic reading of 90 or higher, is considered high blood pressure. Because blood pressure can go up and down during the day, health care providers often re-check a high reading to determine if a woman truly has high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0When high blood pressure is not accompanied by protein in the urine, it is referred to simply as gestational hypertension. Gestational hypertension may progress to preeclampsia, so all women who develop high blood pressure in pregnancy are monitored closely.\u00a0\u00a0Preeclampsia may be accompanied by swelling (edema) of the hands and face; sudden weight gain (5 or more pounds in one week); problems with vision, such as blurriness and flashing lights; severe headaches; dizziness; and pain in the upper right part of the abdomen. A pregnant woman should contact her health care provider right away if she develops any of these symptoms.Preeclampsia usually occurs after about 30 weeks of pregnancy, but can occur any time after 20 weeks. Most cases are mild, with blood pressure around 140/90. If not managed, preeclampsia can cause serious problems.",

            "answer": "I agree with the other posters.I have gestational hypertension but my doctor didnt diagnose it from a BP reading\u00a0\u00a0at just one appointment- she diagnosed it from being high at two separate appointments (sometimes it can be high due to stress etc so doctors often like to see if the numbers remain high on different occasions).\u00a0\u00a0My doctor also wasnt concerned the first time my BP was high.\u00a0\u00a0However, since you have had a nurse remeasure it at a similar high level then this is REAL and your doctor needs to be made aware of this.\u00a0\u00a0As the other posters have said, this is serious and can become much more serious without the appropriate monitering so it is important you get in contact w/ your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has told me to work 20h/week due to high BP and like melimeli I have to go in for a NST (non stress test) every week and have regular checks of urine to make sure Im not developing preeclampsia.",
