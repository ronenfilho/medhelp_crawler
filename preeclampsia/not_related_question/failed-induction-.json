I was desperate to have my daughter when I was 40 weeks. I went on a walk for a mile, the last 50 yards I started jogging and boom my water broke. Had her the next day. Lol.",

I wouldn't dilate, my water bag wouldn't burst, and I wasn't getting any contraction when they give me the pitocin. Eventually on Thursday, they came in and burst my water bag at 2:00 and by 7:10 my first born was here....",

Doesn't have to be outside, you could go to a couple malls and store and baby shop! Make it fun! And you aren't a failure, even if you go in on Tuesday and you still don't have your baby naturally you are not a failure! Some women do not dilate! I never do! I went into labor with this one and they had to stop it but I never dilated! So keep your head up momma! Either way you are gonna have that beautiful baby!",

So it does give him a chance to come on his own but I.just feel even more like I'm gonna be pregnant forever. They had up the pitocin to 24 and the highest was 30 and I only dilated to 2cm and had contractions 1 min apart but they didn't hurt too bad",
