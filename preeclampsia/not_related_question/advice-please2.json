    "question": "I am currently 36 weeks 3 days. Today I have not had any energy whatsoever. I laid around all morning with my daughter and then went to lunch with her and my mom. After that we had to stop at the store so I could pick up my prescription and a few other things. Just getting out to do that had me feeling out of breath and weak all over. It was a struggle just to be out and about. I've had an on and off headache since yesterday along with my vision being kinda off at times and now tonight I'm starting to feeling achy all over similar to what I'd feel like with a fever or the flu. I've been staying hydrated. I'm not sure if this is something I should be worried about or not. I never had this with my first pregnancy. Anyone have some advice of what I should do?",
