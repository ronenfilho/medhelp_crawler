    "question": "I am 33 weeks pregnant. I have been having parts of my body jerk at time. My shoulders and legs are most effected. It doesn't hurt, but it does freak me out. Is this normal? I also have been having a bloated, lots of pressure feeling from my belly button all the way to my \"women area\". I also see tiny strobe light things at times even when not moving. This is my second pregnancy. I had nothing like this with my first. Please let me know what you think. Thank you.",
