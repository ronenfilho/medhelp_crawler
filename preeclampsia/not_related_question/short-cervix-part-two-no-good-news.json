Please!!! :( termination this far along in pregnancy just doesn't seem like a viable answer coming from a doctor. I understand your water could break at any time, but can't you be hospitalized and they monitor you very closely on bed rest? This is just so sad to me.. so hard to comprehend how a doctor finds it so easy to give up on their patient, especially when you've not only entrusted your life, but also the life of your child in their care.",

This is your choice and part of you knows that the right decision would be to wait and see. Demand strict bed rest before settling on what these doctors tell you are right....if she can make it to 24 weeks, 26, 28, or 30...if the only medical reason for you to terminate is a short cervix then the best solution would be to let gravity do the work....keep your hips elevated while laying in bed with only getting up to potty.I'm pro-choice all the way and it really is your choice, allbeit a difficult one, but with a fetus that has no other major medical reason to die, I just dont understand how they can tell you that.I wish you the best of luck and will pray for you and your family.

    "question": "Yesterday April 3rd i woke up feeling great. It was my birthday and i was going to celebrate with my family. I got a call from my doctor that i have a short cervix and i need to go to the hospital right away. Long story short i found out that i have an incompetent cervix. The only choice i had was to terminate my healthy baby girl. Im 22 weeks and at this time an emergency cerclage wasnt going to solve my problems.Still at the hospital and im pondering how come my doctor did not catch this sooner like around 12-13 weeka of my pregnancy?? My husband and i are so upset and just left with why....our first pregnancy, our first child .....everything was perfect and still is because she's healthy ...i see her on the u/s and shes great it just feels so wrong to let her go. Why didnt my doctor catch this. I always said my visits were short and not very informative. She always seemed in a rush.I just cant go thru with this",
