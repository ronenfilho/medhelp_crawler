            "answer": "You're \"extremely fertile\" after birth because you have no idea when you'll be ovulating and your body has a sense of its own right now, so having unprotected sex a lot postpartum can most definitely result in another pregnancy back to back. If so, you really have to take care of yourself, it can cause complications to have pregnancies so close. Most women can do it just fine, but in reality it does take your body about a full year to heal.",

The only reason they say \"wait a year\" is because they think women can't mentally take care of two children close together. But women conceive twins triplets and even more. It's a biased opionion.",

Multiple studies have shown that women who get pregnant again less than 12-18 months after giving birth have a much higher risk of preterm labor, preeclampsia, infection, low birth weight babies, and other complications... this isn't \"a lie\" or \"an opinion\" it's scientifically proven. The risks are significantly elevated. Does that mean every woman will experience them? No. But that doesn't mean ignoring the risks (or belittling those who are more informed about them) will make them go away.Not to mention - considering the fact that nearly a third of babies in the US are delivered by cesarean, and the rate of episiotomies is astronomically higher than in most of the rest of the developed world, the healing process for many women is a whole lot longer than six weeks. The body's healing process has to do with a whole lot more than waiting for the uterus to \"go completely down\" as you put it.",

Just because you obviously didn't have complaications doesn't mean other women who have fallen pregnant so soon after birth dont. A friend of mine got pregnant after 3 months of giving birth and she had issues he was a preemie and had a few problems... There is a whole lot more to \" your body\" then a uterus just because it might only take 6 months for it to shrink back to normal size doesn't mean it's healed or the rest of your body is fine. Pregnancy changes a lot of things like posture and your muscles for an example. Plus comparing the topic on twins and triplets doesn't work. Having one baby and being pregnant again shortly after is a whole different ballgame to caring for two or more babies born at the same time. I know I would be fine if I had twins but I wouldn't want to be pregnant and waddling after my baby and so on .",
