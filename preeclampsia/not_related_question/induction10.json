I've read up on it and saw all the risks, and a forced labor without medical reason is just trying to play God. The baby knows when she is ready, it's almost as if people had no idea what to do before these drugs.(Not bashing you honey if it sounds as if I am) but if you have a choice, I would think very hard on it. I would read up on it and the risks, for both you and your baby. He's going to try to induce me next week as he is a lot of couples, and there's no way. We are refusing strongly against this if there is no medical reason to put my baby and my body through that.",

            "answer": "Lots of complications happened before these 'drugs'. I'm as much a fan of going into labor naturally if possible as anyone, but I know a man (he's eighty) who was over a month overdue. He was a twelve pound baby. That's not something I want to push out of my body, thank you very much.As long as you are able to advocate for yourself, and baby is not in distress and you aren't exhausted, and you are actually progressing, even if it's slow, you have the right to refuse a c section. But here's something you need to know: stress in labor is not helpful. If you are worried and stressed, your body will react by putting more blood flow into your arms and legs (it's called fight or flight, and it enabled our ancestors to get up and run to safety, even in the middle of labor) and less to your labor. This will slow and sometimes even stop labor, leading to the necessity of c section. So figure out some way to deal with that before you go into labor and you'll have a much better experience. Good luck!",

I wasn't bashing her or anyone else for that matter. As stated above. I just gave my opinion on it and if there is something else she is able to do and does have a choice (as it is not medical related) then she should look into it and read about the risks for both her body and her baby.",
