            "answer": "Ive only had 1 and it was in 2013 but..I was able to skin to skin with my daughter in recovery and my husband was allowed in recovery with us. And I had dissolving stitches, not actual stitches the dr had to remove after 6 weeks. Ive heard these were different from a family memeber who had a csection 6yrs ago but it may have been different for you. Good luck to you! I will have my 2nd csection in Nov!",

I also had my husband hold my hand while they did the spinal, the spinal wore off after 4hrs and I ate dinner, the next day they took my cathetar out and I was free to walk around and do whatever I wanted during my stay which was great as the walks to nicu and the cafe really helped my recovery by the time I got home. I'm going for my 2nd csection later this year. Good luck!",

I think the spinal tap was the only iffy part for me as I didnt know what exactly to expect besides the actual surgery. I loved being coherent through it all though and my husband got awesome pictures, with the drs permission. We got a picture of her in the sac after she was pulled out! Amazing but gruesome I know but still amazing!",

            "answer": "My sister had an emergency csection and was not coherent for the first day..but they MADE her get out of bed the next day to use the bathroom and walk around. She had a surplus of meds going through her, she was on the verge of preeclampsia. Her blood pressure skyrocketed and baby was distressed and thats when a csection was called. Anyways, she was like a zombie and when the meds finally wore off, the nurses were encouraging her to get up. @Csections, is there a way you could tour the facility that you will be at? I found that helped with my anxiety as I knew the procedures. (I.e. floor for delivery, floor for recovery, nursery, nurses station, and everything in between) Maybe if thats an option, you could ask questions about their surgery policy and procedures. I think knowing beforehand makes the experience better as you're not worrying about what happens next, IMO.",
