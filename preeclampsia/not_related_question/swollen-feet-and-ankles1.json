To get to the point I have been complain about my feet n hands being numb n very swollen I kept hearing \"it's normal\" well my blood pressure went up last night n that's when they noticed my feet n hands! I couldn't believe neither could my husband.\u00a0\u00a0Basically I had to spent another nite here for monitoring due to swelling. All my blood test n urine test have come back normal. They dnt kno y I am swelling up n having high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my advice is keep telling them n letting them kno ur uncomfortable eventually someone will listen",

            "answer": "I think swollen feet and ankles is pretty normal it's when your face and hands are swollen that you need to worry about or something to that effect.\u00a0\u00a0But you're right about the high blood pressure that's another sign. My friend had her baby in May and she had swollen feet and ankles she said her ankles were so swollen you couldn't see them they blended with her calves",

            "answer": "Yeah ive been swelling super bad in the feet and ankles and for a while and all i hear is its normal. I swell like so crazy. Then i found out i had protein in my urine apparently for 3 weeks. Both are signs of preeclampsia but without the blood pressure, the feet swelling is normal. Last week my blood pressure was high with all those symptoms so they finally got worried and sent me for bloodwork. That came back normal so with all the symptoms, they still say i am good. Im almost 39 weeks. I know the reasons for swelling i get are do you drink enough water, you retain water, do u eat a lot of salt, etc. I personally wouldnt pretend symptoms i dont have. If my blood says i am good i am trusting the dr. I dont want to be induced unless absolutely necessary.",
