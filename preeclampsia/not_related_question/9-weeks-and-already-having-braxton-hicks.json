    "question": "Is it normal with your second child to feel bh so early?? With my daughter i didnt get any until around 20 weeks or so i believe. Maybe even later than that i dont really remember. Im only 9 weeks as of today and i know theyre normal but it feels like its too early for them. Im hydrated and am not too active. What could possibly be bringing them on? I have an appointment on thursday and will be asking my doc as well. Just wanna get some ideas of what it could be",
