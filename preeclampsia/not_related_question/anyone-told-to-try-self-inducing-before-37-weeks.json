I've been walking, cleaning everything like crazy, walking up and down the stairs, sex daily and warm baths. If you have stairs in your house walk down them sweeping them, that'll help work your uterus muscles and may start contractions. Walking starts mine contractions but they aren't strong enough to do anything. Im 2 cm dilated and 80% thinned out.",

And yes, walking up and down the stairs really helps. Sex starts them up too but then they go away. Im gonna try to start doing squats tomorrow after my appt as long as my dr says its okay. I went tuesday for a weight ultrasound and I'll get babys measurements tomorrow. I wanna make sure shes at least 5 lbs, if not I'll wait 2 weeks :)",

    "question": "I'm 35+5 and I'm scheduled to be induced at 37 weeks due to complications. However today my doctor told me that it's safe if my baby comes\u00a0\u00a0any time now and it would be ideal if I went into labor myself without being medically induced and that I can try self inducing. About 2 weeks ago I got steroid shots for my baby because I went into preterm labor and they even gave me shots and meds to stop contractions( which worked) I'm just wondering if anyone else attempted self inducing before 37 weeks and were successful? I'm 1 cm dilated and 60% effaced. I just know I don't want yl try and laxatives. I'd rather stick with walking/ bouncing on a ball/ sex. Any opinions would be appreciated . thanks in advance",
