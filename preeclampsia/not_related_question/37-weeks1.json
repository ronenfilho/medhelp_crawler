My hands and feet have gotten swollen too (this is normal), but two of the signs she told me to look out for are if one hand/foot is noticeably more swollen than the other and if there is a hot or burning feeling that accompanies the swelling!",

    "question": "Hey Ladies! So today I had a docs appointment and an ultrasound and found out little man is 6lbs 11oz and I'm 3cm dialated. I'm due in 18 days and I'm beyond estatic too know I'm actually dialating properly! But I wake up in the middle of the night with my fingers and hands burning because they have become so swollen! Sometimes my feet and sometimes not, but I just woke up about 20 mins ago too pee and my left hand was burning so bad and was completely swollen. I had too take my wedding ring off. Any advice on what I should do or should I be worried?",
