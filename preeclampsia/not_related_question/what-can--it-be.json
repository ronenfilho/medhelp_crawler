            "answer": "Preeclampsia is a serious problem, its dangerously high blood pressure caused by the pregnancy. They only cure is to deliver the baby, as it can lead to a situation when the mother's life is at risk. But it can be managed.Low blood pressure can also cause dizziness.I get randomly dizzy a lot, like you describe with the room spinning even with my eyes closed. I was told it is benign vertigo, it mean that sometimes my inner swells. Normally i take a decongestant and a anti-inflamatory, but that only helps if it is the ear thing, and it not the safest combo while pregnant. It always goes away on its own, though it can last a few hours.",

I just know when i don't eat much i get dizzy.Preeclampsia is caused by being pregnant, so it goes away once the baby is born. It is more common with first or second pregnancies.The list of things that can make you dizzy is really long and go from extremely minor to serious.You just be dehydrated too.",
