            "answer": "Ask your dr to check u for Dysphagia.Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, occurs when a person has trouble getting food or liquid to pass down the mouth or throat. Some people may gag, cough, or choke when trying to swallow, while others may feel like food is stuck in the throat.CausesOne cause is the cancer itself, especially mouth, throat, or esophageal cancers, which can cause the passages to become restricted or narrowed. It is also a common side effect of some cancer treatments, such as radiation therapy, surgery, and, less commonly, chemotherapy.Eating tips for people with difficulty swallowingDepending on the severity and cause of swallowing problems, certain approaches may work better for some people than for others. Try different types of food and ways of eating until you find what works best, while remembering the goal to eat a nutritious diet that has enough calories, protein, and vitamins and minerals. Here are some more tips.\u2022Eat soft, smooth foods, such as yogurt, pudding, or ice cream.\u2022Mash or blend foods, or moisten dry foods with broth, sauce, butter, or milk.\u2022Try thickening liquids by adding gelatin, tapioca, baby rice cereal, or commercial thickening products. Thicker liquids can be easier to swallow.\u2022Use a straw to drink liquids and soft foods.\u2022Eat foods that are cold to help numb pain or at room temperature.\u2022Take small bites, and chew slowly and thoroughly.\u2022Sit upright when eating or drinking.\u2022If you are losing weight, eat small, frequent meals, and choose foods that are high in calories and protein, such as eggs, milkshakes, casseroles, and nutritional shakes.\u2022Avoid dry, coarse, or hard foods and foods that need a lot of chewing.\u2022Meet with a speech pathologist to learn about the foods, and the ways to prepare them, that may be easiest or safest for you to swallow.\u2022Ask for a referral to meet with a registered dietitian for additional advice on eating a balanced diet.Dysphagia can cause people to inhale (aspirate) mouth secretions and/or material they eat or drink. Aspiration can cause acute pneumonia. If aspiration occurs over a long period of time, people may develop chronic lung disease. People who have had dysphagia for a long time are often inadequately nourished and lose weight.CausesAlthough most people take swallowing for granted, it is actually a complicated process. For swallowing to take place normally, the brain must unconsciously coordinate the activity of numerous small muscles of the throat and the esophagus. These muscles must contract strongly and in the proper sequence to push food from the mouth to the back of the throat and then down the esophagus. Finally, the lower part of the esophagus must relax to allow food to enter the stomach. Thus, swallowing difficulty can result from the following:\u2022Disorders of the brain or nervous system\u2022Disorders of the muscles in general\u2022Disorders of the esophagus (a physical blockage or a motility [movement] disorder)Brain and nervous system disorders that cause difficulty swallowing include stroke, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). People with these disorders typically have other symptoms in addition to difficulty swallowing. Many have already been diagnosed with these disorders.General muscle disorders that cause difficulty swallowing include myasthenia gravis, dermatomyositis, and muscular dystrophy.A physical blockage can result from cancer of the esophagus, rings or webs of tissue across the inside of the esophagus, and scarring of the esophagus from chronic acid reflux or from swallowing a caustic liquid. Sometimes the esophagus is compressed by a nearby organ or structure such as an enlarged thyroid gland, a bulge in the large artery in the chest (aortic aneurysm), or a tumor in the middle of the chest.Esophageal motility disorders include achalasia (in which the rhythmic contractions of the esophagus are greatly decreased and the lower esophageal muscle does not relax normally to allow food to pass into the stomach) and esophageal spasm. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) may also cause a motility disorder.EvaluationNot every episode of dysphagia requires immediate evaluation by a doctor. The following information can help people decide when a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.Warning signs:In people with dysphagia, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern. They include\u2022Symptoms of a complete physical blockage (such as drooling or inability to swallow anything at all)\u2022Dysphagia resulting in weight loss\u2022Painful swallowing (odynophagia)\u2022A new problem in nerve, spinal cord, or brain function, particularly any weaknessWhen to see a doctor:People who have warning signs should see a doctor right away unless the only warning sign is weight loss. In such cases, a delay of a week or so is not harmful.People with dysphagia but no warning signs should see their doctor within a week or so. However, people who cough or choke whenever they eat or drink should be evaluated sooner*********** http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/digestive_disorders/symptoms_of_digestive_disorders/difficulty_swallowing.htmlthis is the website ive found all this information on and I think it will help you also cause there is more information on the website then what I had already put down in this comment and I hope it helps u sweetheart please update us whenever u also find out and I wish the best for u and pray everything will turn out the best for u hun!!!!!!",

    "question": "This is going to be long. Please bear with me. I'll try to keep it short but I'm running out of ideas and this is starting to be too much to handle.Some history: I am a light smoker, possible gerd, and have generalised anxiety disorder for which I was taking klonopins for. I am an 18 year old female who is otherwise healthy.Background on the actual issue:One time I choked on food.(some really dry cake) Nothing too serious just had trouble breathing and almost passed out. It happened again, but then I choked so bad my friend had to call an ambulance. (Maybe a few months between the two incidents.)After the first time I'd just have this weird feeling in my throat but I didn't think much of it and it didn't affect me. It just kinda felt like I had too much mucus in my right lung (the side the food went down), but having choked I found it to be normal. I wouldn't cough, but I'd often clear my throat to try and get the feeling to go away.Fast forward to the second time: I was hanging out with my friend when I felt an anxiety attack coming on. I took one of my pills (which are between the size of ibuprofen and asprin) and felt it get stuck. My mouth was kinda dry so I didn't think much of it and took a big gulp of gatorade to help get the pill down. This went poorly, as I could literally feel and hear the liquid go straight into my lung. Almost immediately I started to flop like a fish. I ended up laying on my side in the grass, forcing myself to heave to try and get everything up. An ambulance was called, but I luckily was able to compose myself enough and have enough breath to show my friend how to do chest compressions to help me clear my air way.This is where the real trouble begins:Ever since the second time I choked, I've been having issues swallowing food and the like. Almost every time I eat anything, I start having difficulty breathing, feel a heaviness and a sharp pain on the right side of my body, towards the inside of the bottom of my right breast, (like if you were to draw a line from the inside corner of your right eye straight down until you got to the bottom of your breast. Almost pin point on where the pain is.) The right side of my throat feels tight, and then I typically have to kinda bend over a little and try to force out whatever I just swallowed from wherever it may be stuck. This is accompanied by wheezing, and I have to take an inhaler for it.What I've done about it:I've been to several doctors, none of which can seem to help me. First I went to a convenient care place, as I ate something and only a little piece got stuck. It was uncomfortable but I could breathe fine. They ended up sending me to the ER. From there they discharged me with nothing but a hospital bill, and I went to my family doctor. From there, I told him everything that I've said here, and he scheduled me for a chest x ray. This came up clean. by this point, maybe a month has passed and I am hardly eating if I am at all. I've already lost about 15 lbs in that one month span.Next, they sent me for a barium swallow test. Lo and behold it comes up negative. Maybe another month and a half goes by waiting for a gastroenterologist. (What my doctor suggested the next step be.) Still not eating still losing a lot of weight. I have a I finally get in to see the doctor and I tell him everything. He tells me that it sounds like I have gerd and possibly strictures, and that was causing my issues. He also takes some blood tests for a few things. I think one was something about an allergy and there was one for thyroid or something like that? I really wish I could remember exactly what. Oh well. Then we make an appointment for my strictures to be stretched. This happens and I take on solid food for the first time in what has got to be about three months. It seems to have helped, not fixed, but definitely helped. I am tempted to attribute this to some anxiety being lifted.Fast forward again to now. My condition has worsened dramatically in the past few weeks. I went back to the gastroenterologist and he basically told me there's nothing he can so anymore. I'm at my wits end. Today, I ate something and shortly after felt as though I was about to pass out. I've used my inhaler about three times just today and I feel as though I'm becoming dependant on it. Ice had to do the usual bending over a bit to force it out, and for the first time I had wheezing not just oon exhale, but also on inhale. I feel better now that I'm writing this novel, but last night I actually had an emotional breakdown over this. It's nerve racking. I don't know what is wrong with me, and nobody else seems to know either.So here's the real question:Based on the information provided, does this sound like anything you've ever b heard of before? The one doctor said it was gerd related, but that doesn't sit well with me as it's only the right side that I have issues with. (if it was both lungs I feel as though I'd honestly be dead.) Could it be a trachea thing that I should go to a pulmonary doctor for? Or should I go back to the gastroenterologist and ask for some different tests? I'm really at a loss here.And if you've made it this far, even if you just skimmed, thank you for giving me the time of day.Xoxo, fmlonsomerns.",
