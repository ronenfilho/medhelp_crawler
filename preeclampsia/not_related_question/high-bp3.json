            "answer": "Hello my mother had trouble with her bp during her pregnancy. I know that meds can be scary during pregnancy but talk to your ob he knows best what is safe for you & the baby. Get lots of rest & stay cool the hotter your body is the higher your bp goes up & find out if bp is high because your retaining fluids, you will have to cut out salt completely. My bp goes out of control when I take vitamin b-12 check into your prenatal vitamin maybe that is the cause, b-12 is great if you're low in energy but not if you have uncontrolled high bp. Good luck and please keep me posted.",

            "answer": "Listen to your doctor please. At 22 weeks mine started to climb my doc gave me pills to control it. I was skeptical I didn't take them for about 2 weeks. I finally I took them. After I developed preeclampsia at 25 weeks. I went to the doc because I didn't feel the baby move as much as she usually did. Got sent to labor and delivery. I was in the hospital for 9 days and on the 6th she passed away. Don't play\u00a0\u00a0with that it is very dangerous. Good luck with your pregnancy and listen to your doc. She was my first.",
