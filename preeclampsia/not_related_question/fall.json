Baby is pretty protected but having a fall can cause labour. My boss fell when walking her dog at 31 weeks. She went on to have what she thought was just back pain for days at just 32 weeks her waters broke and she had her little baby. Baby is completely fine and was a healthy weight too but probably could of been prevented if she had asked to be checked over.",
