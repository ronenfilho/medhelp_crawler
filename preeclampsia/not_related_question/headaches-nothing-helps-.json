Since I've been pregnant I take tylenol with caffeine no aspirin though and it works great. I take it as soon as I start to feel it and literally 5-10 minutes later it's gone. I of course asked my MD before I started taking these, and he said it's fine to take I don't tale them everyday but if I need to I do. This kind of Tylenol is for tension headaches and someone else mentioned coffee you can drink about half a cup black and 2 extra strength Tylenol this works as well. Good luck!",
