MY NCS got 100 times worse during pregnancy. I spent many times in the hospital with IV's because my blood pressure would get so low. I probably shouldnt have another one but my husband and I are going to try the end of the summer. The labor and delivery I was really worried about but that was the easy part. I did get dizzy towards the end of pushing but overall I did fine. My only advice is to make sure you are well hydrated drink drink drink drink drink. It was hard for me because I was so nauseous all the time but keeping hydrated is the best thing for u.",

Experience blood pressure as low as 60/40, a heart rate as high as 161, and my pulse ox hovers around 85% causing me to be on oxygen. Our baby has stopped growing due to the lack of oxygen I experienced for 30weeks before we could get a doctor to take us seriously. (We go in a gain Oct. 5th to have him measured). We will NOT be having anymore children. My husband actually gets his vasectomy this Friday. This has been a terrifiing conditoin for me.

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with NCS when I was 19 (passed out in 7 minutes on the tilt table) ; I am currently 28. My husband and I are moving towards getting pregnant. I say moving towards because, with NCS, it's gotta be planned.Prior to our pregnancy plan, my doctor has had me on 30 MG of Adderall XR (the ADHD drug) a day which is combined with 5 MG of Proamatine every 3-4 hours. I cannot tell you what relief these medications bring. I am able to get up and go to work (as a teacher) and function at a normal level on a daily basis. My doctor's name is Blair Grubb and he is connected to Toledo University's College of Medicine. He is an expert in the autonomic dysfunction field and is simply a genius (He has patients coming to him from other countries-- that's how good he is).Dr. Grubb ,and his cohorts, did a controlled study on pregnant women who have NCS. They found some amazing things and have published an article: \" Outcomes of Pregnancy in Patients with Preexisting Postural Tachycardia Syndrome\". It was published in the PACE (Pacing and Electrophysiology section, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo Ohio. Published in August 2009, volume 32). They studied 22 pregnant women: during the course of study symptoms remained unchanged in 3, improved in 12, and worsened in 7 patients. All women completed their pregnancies with limited to no complications. The major medications of the study were beta-blockers, midiodrine, SSRIs, fludrocotisone, and combinations of the medications.I encourage all of you to have your doctors find this article.Currently, I am stepping down off of the Adderall (not safe during pregnancy), and modifying my medications. I have a high-risk OBGYN who is willing to work with Dr. Grubb, my husband and I, and our future little one. According to both my OBGYN and my cardiologist, there is no reason to avoid pregnancy and it is a workable situation.I wish all of you luck. I know it is incredibly frustrating and discouraging.",

I have NCS but they had a hard time deciding if it was POTS or NCS. I have a small mitralvalve issue. With my daughter my condition improved the longer i was pregnant the more 'normal' i felt. More energy, normal BP, less fainting.Early on i fainted alot. Then for the first time ever i had high blood pressure. During my first go round i was on salt tablets to increase my BP as the BP normalized they lowered my dose but when i went high i had to stop the salt and drink a liter a day of Gatoraid, and other drinks. i got hugely bloated and had a csection at 37 weeks my BP was 197/100 right before they got my daughter out.This time around with my son i have had a much better time of it. Two or three fainting spells early on but since then other than unrelated gallbladder issues much easier. I have had some spells (palpatations and just icky days). I would say that managing stress, fluid intake, getting your meals worked out that will help alot. With the meal thing remember that if you eat too much at once t can cause blood to pol in your digestive track. I found that not eating often enough or toom much at once really sets me off when pregnant.I am really wondering about Labo and delivery we are trying for VBAC this time and i was wondering if anyone had advice during the actual labor and delivery. I have to have an epidural because of the previous c-section in case of rupture. I would like to say that the c-section was a hard recovery because of the NCS. I lost a lot of fluid quickly and the drugs messed with me. We just don't heal as fast as others.",

            "answer": "Am 28 and was diagnosed with NCS in 2008...would have been sooner but after an EKG, Echo, CT, etc. I thought it was related to stress or migraines.\u00a0\u00a0After having an intense episode while seated and giving a training session for my job, I decided that I needed to find out what was causing my fainting.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried beta blockers (metropolol sp?) and another that I can't remember the name of...back in the beginning of 2009 but then had several episodes while on the medications.\u00a0\u00a0Considering the side affects of the meds (angina, heart palpitations) I decided that it made more sense to manage it myself without feeling so terrible (extremely tired/increased chest pain).\u00a0\u00a0My syncope seems to be more infrequent than some others that have posted - have not had a full episode in 6 months but may also be due to avoiding my triggers.\u00a0\u00a0I have a friend with vasovagal whose syncope seems to come on much faster than mine so it may depend on each person.\u00a0\u00a0For me it's definitely feeling naseous, palms start to sweat and then when I'm close to fainting my vision is messed up (pixelated is probably the only word I have to describe it...I can see a word and identify the letters in the word but I can't tell you what the word is, kind of like my brain can't process it and put it together?)\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else have issues like that?\u00a0\u00a0Growing up I thought when it happened that it was a migraine but am now realizing that I was probably sitting/standing too long.I'm very grateful to all of you for posting as it is difficult to find out information on NCS and I have been wondering about issues with pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep me updated on your progress - I'm looking to have kids in the next few years and want to know what I'm up against.\u00a0\u00a0Would also encourage everyone to get a full copy of their medical records from their cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0I pulled mine recently to switch to a female cardiologist (FINALLY found one, am just more comfortable with a female vs. male) and found on my chart under Atria it says the atrial size is normal for both left and right but then continues to say 'The discontinuity of the interatrial septum is suggestive of an atrial septal defect.\u00a0\u00a0There is a spontaneous right to left interatrial shunt.\u00a0\u00a0The shunting is mild in size.\"\u00a0\u00a0This was news to me as it was never discussed in my 4 visits with this cardiologist so I'm going to ask about it (have an appt. Thurs.) to find out if this could be a contributing cause/trigger.Also am wondering if any of you have a tendency to break out into hives frequently?\u00a0\u00a0I never had a problem with this growing up but in the last two years it seems I constantly break out into hives (I'm pale so this is pretty hard to hide and very embarassing!) on my chest and sometimes on my face (spreading from my ears across my cheeks).\u00a0\u00a0Other times when I am stressed I will get this very dark red band across my nose (looks like someone punched me...yeah good times).\u00a0\u00a0I've tried several doctors that told me it was Uticaria and that my skin is very reactive to emotions/histamine release.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else have this issue?\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if it's at all related to chemicals that could also cause NCS?\u00a0\u00a0At one point I tried Claritin at night, Zyrtec in the morning as well as large doses of Vitamin C to decrease the amount of histamine produces and Bromelain (sp?) to prevent histamine from attaching at the receptor site.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately this just led to having hives and being really really really tired!",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with NCS when i was 15 during a tilt table test where I flat lined for 28 seconds 30 mins into the test. Then at the age of 17 i was diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension as well. At that point I had asked my cardiologist if I would need a high risk Ob/Gyn if i were to get pregnant and they said yes. I am just curious if anyone has had what i have and had a successfull pregnancy?",

    "question": "Hi my name is Beth. I was diagnosed with NCS when I was 20. I am now 27. I can't stand for more than a couple minutes without having to sit down. I was taking Proamatine and Florinef, which helped at first but gradually I was getting worse and worse. The fatigue was horrible, I couldn't do anything during the day but sleep. Then I started having shortness of breath and chest pain everyday associated with NCS. No doctor has been able to help. I finally found something that is helping alot. But I'm still not cured of this. It's a natural supplement.... called Ambrotose, it has completely alleviated the chest pain and shortness of breath as long as I take it everyday. And another product called PLUS which supports the endocrine system which is the root problem of this disorder... the adrenal glands aren't functioning correctly, so this helps balance it out. It helps tackle the root prob and not just the symptoms like prescription meds. I want to know what has helped others and has anyone gotten pregnant with this condition and can your body handle a pregnancy with NCS? What did you experience? Does it make you worse? How did you handle childbirth too?",
