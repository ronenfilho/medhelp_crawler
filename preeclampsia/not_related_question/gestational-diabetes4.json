The sandwich only had 46g and I only had like 6 fries. After we ate we went and walked a corn maze for like 30 min and my sugar was still 134. Im usually really good but it seems like every other week ill get a high reading when it shouldn't be. My ob said something to me about meds too but my baby isn't big hes normal so idk. I don't have to go in for nst or weekly u/s. Just aggravates me.",
