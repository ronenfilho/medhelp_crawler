Seems like with any situation, you only hear the bad from the media, research, etc. There are lots and lots of women who have inductions everyday and things are fine! I woudn't stress too much! If preeclampsia sets in you will have much more on your plate to worry about. I can't think a doctor would induce without a good reason! :) Good luck!!!",

            "answer": "I had three inductions out of four pregnancies. I am hoping this isn't the case this time, but my children are all perfectly fine. I have never heard of the autism link, either. At 37 weeks your baby should be ready and I think the risk if you have some preeclampsia outweighs the benefits at this point of keeping baby in there longer. Good luck, I think things will work out just fine.",

            "answer": "thnx all for ur suggestions , feeling better now. i'll talk with my doctorregarding my concerns. and the autism link,http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/brtrauma.html#AutismLABOR INDUCTION EPIDEMIC AND AUTISM EPIDEMIC: IS THERE A LINK?There are many reasons why further studies about labour induction as a possible risk factor for autism are urgently needed. The first one is that the authors of the oldest studies included in our database came across risks associated with induction, whereas the most recent studies could not take into account this variable. 'Labour induction' should be explicitly taken into consideration, because it can be associated either with birth by the vaginal route (with or without intervention such as forceps), or with caesarean birth. Another reason is that the epidemic of autism and the epidemic of induction seem to have developed side by side. Most importantly, a third reason is that the results of recent studies suggest that children with autistic disorder show alterations in their oxytocin system.The first clues came from a study of midday blood samples from 29 autistic and 30 age-matched normal children, all prepubertal.(26) It appeared that the autistic group had significantly lower blood oxytocin levels than the normal group. Oxytocin increased with age in the normal but not the autistic children. These results inspired an in-depth inquiry of the oxytocin system of autistic children. In recent years it has become clear that oxytocin can appear in the brain in several forms. There is the nonapeptide oxytocin (OT) and the 'C-terminal extended peptides', which are described together as OT-X. The OT-X represent intermediates of oxytocin synthesis that accumulate due to an incomplete processing machinery. Twenty eight male children, diagnosed with autistic disorder were compared with 31 age-matched non psychiatric control children: there was a decrease in blood OT, an increase in OT-X and an increase in the ratio of OT-X/OT in the autistic sample, compared with control subjects.(27)\u00a0\u00a0In other words autistic children show alterations in the oxytocin system: there are deficits in the processing machinery of oxytocin.Such findings are of paramount importance at a time when an accumulation of data from animal studies confirm the potent effects of oxytocin (and the parent hormone vasopressin) on social behaviour, communication and rituals. Furthermore we are currently learning that oxytocin brain receptors undergo major changes during development. Among humans, the period surrounding birth is considered a period of dramatic reorganization of central oxytocin binding. We must add that, when reaching a certain degree of maturation, the oxytocin system of the fetus probably participates in the physiological initiation of labour. Artificial induction of labour in general, particularly the use of drips of synthetic oxytocin, create situations that undoubtedly interfere with the development and the reorganization of the oxytocin system in such a critical period. This fact alone is a reason for further epidemiological studies focusing on labour induction as a possible risk factor. It would be useful to know also how autistic children release oxytocin. Oxytocin is more effective when released rhythmically, in a succession of fast pulsations. Today it is not impossible to measure the rhythmicity or pulsatility of oxytocin releaseIF U GOOGLE 'LABOUR INDUCTION AND AUTISM\" U CAN GET MORE INFO. THNX.",

Alot of those are against anything unatural. I HAVE never heard of that and have read numerous things on the topic. It also sounded like the link was between the pitocin and autism.Things to keep in mind 1 in 150 cases of autism1 in 94 is boys there have been no DEFINITE links with anything, alot of thoeries out there. Immunizations is of course the biggest culprit along with environmental factors and genes.I would not worry to much about it.Good luck to you.",

    "question": "hi,i am a first time mom, due 0n july 1st. on my last prenatal visit , i had 3+ protein in my urine sample with dipstick test. my doctor said dipstick is not reliable, so she ordered 24hr urine test. results came out today, in 24hrs urine sample my protein was 308[doc said nrl is 300]. so its only minimally higher than the nrl value.my BP is fine throughout my pregnancy n it is in the range of 96/60. but still they want to induce on 12th june, i would be 37 weeks by that time. is inducing absolutely necessary for me? i hav heard so many bad things abt inducing, that it increases the chance of C-section, baby may hav autism etc. can i tell my doctor that i dont want to get induced? please help, i am really feeling scared.",
