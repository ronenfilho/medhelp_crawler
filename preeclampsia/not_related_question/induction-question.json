I here that if you get the patocin the contractions are hard and come on fast. Also for being induced most mama's get the epideral becuase of how hard the labor starts",

            "answer": "I was induced with my first.They stripped my membranes and then instantly put me in Pitocin (this was a Wednesday at 8pm). I was only about 4cm dilated when I asked for the epidural - they said they couldn't give one to me because I wasn't dilated enough, but by Thursday night I couldn't take it anymore, I was in SO much pain so they finally gave it to me (Thursday night at midnight) but it didn't work at ALL, i still felt everything and then Friday at 6am they broke my water thinking it would help, and at noon Friday they came in and said I was still only 4cm, so at 3pm I was essentially forced into a C-section because I wasn't dilating anymore and I was in so much pain I just wanted it to be over :(Because my epidural didn't work - I had to be asleep during the C-section, meaning that my bf at the time (her dad) couldn't be in the room either. And because of how long I was in labor for and how much CRAP they pumped into me, Riley wasn't breathing when she was born and had to be resuscitated and spend 3 days in the NICU. She was almost a day and a half old before I could even hold her.It was horrible enough to make me rethink wanting any more kids. But I'm 19wks along and have done LOTS of research about induction and I refuse to let that happen again as I want a Med free, Intervention free birth this time.Probably didn't help hearing my horror story, lol. But I figured I'd share - cause it sucked!",

I honestly would recommend getting an epidural as contractions hurt a lot worse then going into labor yourself. But you will do great, I promise!

The contractions hurted so bad I wanted a epidural they gave me one then at 4:38 Friday I had my son. I just had my daughter 2 weeks ago and I had to b induced again which I really didn't want because of the pain the first time but they had to because my water started to break Monday night at like 9 9:30 I went to the hospital Tues morning around 11 they induced me I was on that pitocin for what it seemed like forever because I wasnt dialating and had no contractions but I finally started having them that night and at 6:38 am she was born all natural it was great",

With having had both natural and induced, if it is just a planning thing to be induced I say just wait it out.. but if it is a must I say get the epidural early and it makes everything better.

I know you said your due date is in 4 days, but I think unless there is a medical need for an induction, I would avoid it at all costs! Seriously, if labor doesn't happen as fast as they want it to, they will do a cs. If you can I'd try natural methods of induction until then and see if something else can get labor going.",

            "answer": "You can just refuse the induction if you like. There seems to be no real medical reason for it, or if there is they certainly didn't make it clear to you, and doing an induction at that date in a healthy, normal first pregnancy is actually against best medical practice. As a first time mum particularly, your body can take longer to prepare, and forcing it to open up before it's ready can be more intense than natural labour and lead to extra stress on baby. Up to 2 weeks past a due date is totally safe and normal... I'd definitely refuse if it was me, unless there was some medical reason it was needed like preeclampsia or something serious. Not everyone has problems of course, but early induction certainly raises your risk of problems and chances of caesarian... And so I would just go with the lower risk option, rather than the option that makes it easier for a doctor to plan their weekend of golf.",
