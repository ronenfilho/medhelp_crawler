            "answer": "p.s....my consultant is a pregnancy/fetal specialist.iv been under his care since 2009 when i found my baby had gross abnormalities\u00a0\u00a0anyway he knows iv had protein for at least 2 yrs almost straight! We both thiught qit was purely b/c i was preg that my kidneys couldnt cope with extra waste(not sue if protein was present in 09.may b i could find ou) i went to see consultant about pcr results.only he wernt there so i seen some other lady doc who was more intrested in talking to my partner about the price per m2 for her extention(he was in work gear) when i got home b/c i was none the wiser i checked my note and in the back where blood an urine results from lab are kept i seen the heqding read: **ckd ks1 if other evidence of renal damage is present**Astricks anall.i rang gp to discus as if frightend me.i cant remember what he said but he palmed me off! Thats y i was looking in to ckd..i know protein isnt the only/sure sign of renal damage or disease but surely to have such high readings for so long deserves more tests than blood an urine over and over again.plus ur kidneys dont leak protein for nothing do they? Xx so much for short story :/",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. The most common cause of proteinuria is kidney damage resulting from diabetes and hypertension. Others could be due to urinary tract infections, immune disorders, trauma and cancer. Some of the chronic infections such as tuberculous kidney may require (IVU / IVP) intravenous pyelography / urography for diagnosis (as well as urine culture for tubercle bacilli.). Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.He will ask for blood tests, urine culture, an x ray and an ultra sonogram of the abdomen. Sometimes he may ask for an Intravenous pyelogram and a CT scan.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

I go back to my doctors this week, she said I will probably be referred to renal clinic, spilling protein through your kidneys will damage them more, so my GP said it needs to be sorted.\u00a0\u00a0It can be caused by a number of other diseases, so they tested my for Lupus, Diabeatis, other autoimmune disorders, all normal.\u00a0\u00a0So they are thinking its a primary disease of the kidneys itself.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know for sure yet.\u00a0\u00a0I did have heart failure through pregnancy and maybe thats caused some permanent damage.\u00a0\u00a0I notice you live in Warrington.... I do too!Make sure you follow it up, protein isnt good for the kidneys at all, need to find out the cause and get medication to help, especially if you are young.",

My function function eGFR was over 90% so normal, but you can still have kidney disease going on with your kidneys remain normal for a while. Eventually the protein will affect them, so they may put me on an ACE inhibitor to reduce protein, I've look these before when I was in heart failure, they are used for the heart as well. I understand they can also protect the kidney. I have been spilling the protein for past two years since my child's birth, and kidney function has remained normal at present. I know it was reduced to 75% during preeclampsia.GP said the neph may do a biopsy. My concern was it was being caused by some other sinister underlying condition, but all my bloods are normal, so really don't know what's causing it. Hopefully will find out.Sorry your function has declined I hope you get it sorted soon. How do you feel?",
