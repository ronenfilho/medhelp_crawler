Just remember to drink alot of water (it flushes the sugars out) and also to exercise (it also helps regulate your blood sugar) So if I have time... I will eat my dinner and then go out for like a 20 min walk or longer if I can and my blood sugar is always good when I have to test it.",

Id even make an omelet for a snack if I was really hungry and snack on diet yogurts for my sweet tooth. If I ate something naughty like some hot chips or a burger, I'd go for a half hour walk to keep the sugar levels down. You will soon work out what works for you and your body.",
