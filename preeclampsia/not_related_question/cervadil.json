            "answer": "Just had cervadil induction back in April. I was a fingertip dilated, Dr inserted cervadil around 6pm, it stays in 12 hours. Well 6am Dr takes out cervadil, it did nothing! They couldn't even break my water (was showing signs of preeclampsia) so had to get a Csection. This does happen sometimes but it's less likely to not work. It all depends on how your body responds to the medication. Not trying to freak you out, just be aware that there is a possibility that it may not work.",

            "answer": "Labor and delivery nurse here. Just know that cervidil is a met hi I'd of induction but it's purpose is to getbthe cervix ready for labor, more soft and stretchy, not to make your cervix open. While cervidil often causes cramps and even painful contractions, it may or may not change the dilation of your cervix (so don't get discouraged). It can stay in for 12 hours but sometimes it can come out earlier. Some women get 2 doses before getting to move on to a balloon or pitocin. Expect a pretty uneventful night with cramps. Get rest because during the day you will have visitors and increasing pain until you are dilated far enough for an epidural. Until then, you can use iv pain m3ds to take the edge off. Good luck. You'll be fine if you just know that labor is not pain free and learn to breathe through any pain you have. Unrealistic expectations are what cause so many women to sort of tire out mentally, then physically, from labor pain and the labor process way too soon. Then it's hard to calm someone down who gets worked up about every single contraction and keep them focused. I hope this helps!!",
