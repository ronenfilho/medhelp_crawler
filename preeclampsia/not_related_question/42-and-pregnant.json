            "answer": "First off, congrats on your pregnancy, and know your not alone.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of us are choosing to have babies in our 40's.\u00a0\u00a0My son was born just a week before my 41st birthday.\u00a0\u00a0He is almost 4 now and the picture of health.\u00a0\u00a0I was a very active member here in those days, and there are a large group of us in the same boat who still stay in touch.Really, there is nothing different in terms of pregnancy then any other age.\u00a0\u00a0You will find your OB will use the term \"advanced maternal age\" which can make you feel positively grandmotherly..lol.\u00a0\u00a0And you may decide to have extra tests that are not typically recommended in younger moms.Your OB will want to do a first trimester screen.\u00a0\u00a0This is a combination of ultrasound and bloodwork which is used to determine your odds of trisonomies 13, 18 and 21.\u00a0\u00a0This is more common in older moms, although more often then not children are born typical.\u00a0\u00a0Based on these results, your OB may recommend amnio or other ways to determine for certain.\u00a0\u00a0My first trimester odds came back 1:13.\u00a0\u00a0I did amnio and discovered my son was totally typical, so try not to worry about this, it's just a formality.\u00a0\u00a0Some OB's recommend going straight to CVS or amnio, and this is completely your choice.\u00a0\u00a0Do your homework, do not be afraid to ask questions, and make sure that whatever choice you make is the best one for you!Other then that most pregnancies for those of us in our 40's are treated no differently then in younger women.\u00a0\u00a0We do have a slightly increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and other medical conditions, however the majority of women I know had none of these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Being more common does not mean it will happen.Congratulations again, and I wish you all the best!",

My advice....don't stress about it,\u00a0\u00a0otherwise fear will conjure all kinds of weird stuff in your mind.\u00a0\u00a0Just eat healthy ....veggies and fruits, and try and get some activity done for atleast 30 minutes....walking is great. If walking stresses you..let it be.",
