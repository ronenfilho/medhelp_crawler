I'm so happy you responded.",

            "answer": "I also took vic's while pregnant...but they were rx'd and my use was minimal. Before I found out I was pregnant I was using...but stopped right away (had no idea there were wds and didn't have any....my use wasn't that much) but as the pregnancy went on the pain got harder and harder on my back. My son was born early and in NICU for 8 days... this was ONLY because of my preeclampsia.... The dr and I did not feel it had anything to do w/the use of the pain meds.Please not just for your sake but your babies sake.... get clean... you don't want to be hooked on pills.... I realized after watching my son's 1st Bday party video the next day that I didn't even remember have the stuff I said or did b/c I was so loaded on pills. Please don't be like me.... Don't get me wrong he has always been cared for and spoiled rotten.... but I hate that feeling that I don't remember stuff.Keep posting...you will find lots of friends and support here!JoAnn",

I am doing this weaning thing (which I've never been able to try because if the pills are there I will take them) but I have a real good reason to stop now and after reading this site, I had no idea that the sub is more potent than meth. I dont need this in my system at all. I hope to take it down to 6/7.5 mg pills a day Monday, then 5 pills on Tues, 4 pills Wed and so forth but I gotta get the sub out of my system at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0I got a lot on my plate right now but I think this site will be helpeful and I thank you so much for the advise because like I said NOBODY in my circle knows abou this part of me so this site will be my form of NA couseling :-)",
