            "answer": "I was induced with my first child. I was overdue but it seems my body wasn't ready either, it took a total of 23 hrs for the entire process, no where near 4 days though :( but it honestly wasn't all that bad. I'm in the same boat as you now, had high bp at my 34 week appointment, got sent to the hospital and diagnosed with preeclampsia and have been here every since. I am 37 weeks tomorrow and will be induced at midnight tonight. I'm thinking its going to be an even longer process since I'm early this time but I guess I'll find out tonight! I'll let you know how it went tomorrow I guess LOL. I hope everything turns out well at your appointment though, good luck!",

That's what I think my body just wont be ready at 37wks. I really wanted a natural birth like I had with my daughter. I wish you all the best and good luck for your induction and I will keep an eye out for an update xx",

    "question": "Hey ladies, so I've been to the hospital today to see my consultant due to my BP. My blood pressure always darts up and down when I'm pregnant. I was induced with my son due to it but luckily my daughter came on her own.My bp decided to be up today and I have now been put on a low dose of meds to settle it (I've been experiencing bad headaches aswell) I'm 33wks today and I'm back to see him at 36wks to be scanned to check growth and fluid around her (I had a condition where I had to my fluid around my daughter)So depending on the out come of the scan and how my bp is I could possibly be induced at 37wks........booooooh :'( something I really didnt want however I fully understand if its best for baby girl and me then of course I'll do it. My first induction was horrendous, I was induced on my due date and my body was not ready at all not by a long shot so I'm wondering if any of you ladies experienced second time around inductions more successful (I was in for 4days being induced and it was only on the 4th I showed progress) baring in mind at 37wks my body wont really be ready at least I wouldn't of thought I would be. The thought of it all scares me. I'm hoping for positive results from the scan but I cant help but worry x x x",
