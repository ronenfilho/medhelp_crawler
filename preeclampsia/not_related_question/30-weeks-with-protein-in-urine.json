And told me to look out for some swelling, if this happens to call them or go to ER. In my family, kidney disease is very genectic. They are monitoring me already, they are alittle worried about my background! So, I hope it all turns out ok for you!! I'm sorry sweetie!",

It was probably due to the fact that, while collecting the first sample I had very less flow and had to collect from the start of the flow.Next time I made sure to have good amount in my bladder and collected the mid flow and it turned out fine.Vaginal discharge interefere with the result more often.",

He informed me that it was a small amount, but if the numbers go up during my next appointment in two weeks, it is a sign of kidney failure (my kidney) and they would have to take Veronika right away. Any of you had small amount of protein and it did not increase? I am not fricking out, but want to make sure I get things ready if this should happen.",
