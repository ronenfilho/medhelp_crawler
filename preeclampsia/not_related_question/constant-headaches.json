            "answer": "If you normally drink coffee or soda (ie caffeine) I would try that first. But if you don't normally drink things with caffeine, I would try Tylenol. If Tylenol doesn't work call your doctor. My doctor told me to call if I had any headaches that could not be controlled by Tylenol because it could be a sign of pre-eclampsia",

            "answer": "It may also be a good idea for your doc to check your iron levels. A lot of headaches are from the increase in blood volume, but if your iron is low it could be contributing. Another thought that has helped me is to see a chiropractor. I was nervous about this at first, but I found a great one with experience in prenatal adjustments & it has been AMAZING. I only go when I feel my back pulling or if I'm getting a lot of headaches & I found that sometimes just a simple adjustment really does the trick. But I agree- either way, you'll also want to rule out preeclampsia & anemia.",
