Going over speed bumps. Unfortunately none of them are proven, but worth a try. Also drinking castor oil but be careful with all of them. Good luck lovely x",

As much walking as you can handle and my doc told me lots of sex, the sperm helps soften the cervix apparently, ive dialated from not at all to a the in the last 3 days from walking around my complex and up and down stairs, and only had sex once.

I wish he could cook until he's done bakin' and he decides when that Is. I juss wanted to wish you luck! Hopefully our babies will want to come out soon, I really don't want to be Induced!!!
