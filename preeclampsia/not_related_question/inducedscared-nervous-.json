            "answer": "Ive had high blood pressure throughout my whole pregnancy and now the baby's belly is measuring small.everything else is fine they said but they think it would be safest to take her early that way it doesn't lead to complications at birth. I have to go see a high risk doctor in a couple of days to get a second opinion. But my doctor said she dont know if I will even last to 37 weeks. They have been worried about preterm labor and preeclampsia throughout my pregnancy though.",

            "answer": "Here is my personal experience but please remember that everyone is different!I was induced at 36 weeks because of severe preeclampsia. My blood pressure was through the roof and I had massive amounts of protein in my urine. Make sure you eat before you go in to get induced. You won't be able to eat while you're on pitocin. When they started me on the pitocin I didn't notice any contractions at first but according to the monitor I was definitely having them. I started my induction at 1 cm dilated 80% effaced. After about 6 hours on pitocin I didn't progress so they used a balloon cathedar to help my cervix open. That dang thing hurt!!! After another 7 hours I finally passed the balloon through my cervix and I was 5cm dilated. Good news was while the balloon was in they stop pitocin and you're able to eat lightly. After I passed the balloon they started the pitocin again at a higher dose. I definitely felt the contractions. They were so painful and I thought I had a high pain tolerance. I didn't get my epidural until 28 hours into labor. They checked me again I was still only.5cm so they manually broke my water. Contractions got worse and worse but no progression. My heart rate started to drop while my BP was going up and up. After 36 hours of labor I was told it would be in my best interest to get an emergency cesarean. I agreed and had my beautiful baby at 11 48 am on September 12",

            "answer": "I had my son at 35wks via csection as induction was considered unsafe due to bp already 170/140 and labour raising bp however I have heard they can bring your bp down a little with the epidural.",

            "answer": "Im just worried about it.I was hoping to go into labor naturally but they have made it clear that it isnt an option. My blood pressure has pretty much been under control my whole pregnancy except when the baby's dad is around. I just really don't want to have a c-section. Im not great with pain and it seems like most people who get induced due to something like my problem then they end up in labor forever or having a c-section. Im just getting extremely nervous now.",

    "question": "Im 34 weeks and 3 days.my doctor is talking about inducing me around 37 weeks. Im starting to get really nervous because its only a little over two weeks.I can't wait for my little princess to be here but im a ftm and terrified of labor and delivery. I've heard that getting induced can make the process drag on forever in some cases. What will they do to induce me? Can that lead to c-section? Whats your experience with being induced?",
