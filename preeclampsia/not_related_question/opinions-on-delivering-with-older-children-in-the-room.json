I would be more concerned if it takes a while and keeping a 2 year old entertained? My 14 yo old girl is helping me out this time around and she is a little leary, but I figured it'd be a good lesson in keeping her away from sex until she's married- lol",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I'm going to have my mom there to help keep an eye on him. I'm possibly going to have a home birth. More than likely be in a birthing center and have the water birth I've been dreaming of since I was pregnant with my little boy but preeclampsia put that off. So as long as all goes well I'm either doing the home or water birth but leaning more toward the water birth. I was thinking that it wouldn't be so bad with a water birth because the pool is so tall and he's my little Shorty and can't really see over the pool. Plus I was wanting him to hold the baby right after his dad.",
