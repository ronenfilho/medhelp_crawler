            "answer": "That happened with my first pregnancy. My son stopped growing at 28weeks. I was referred to a high risk specialist and was given a level 2 ultrasound. The doc said the blood flow was great and he didn't see any problems as to why he wasn't growing. My son grew just a tad bit more. I ended up having him by emergency csection at 35weeks due to severe preeclampsia. Apparently even for a premie he was tiny. He only weighed 4lbs 7oz.My husband and i were petrified about me being labeled as high risk and seeing a new doc plus going on bed rest but i assure you those docs are amazing.",
