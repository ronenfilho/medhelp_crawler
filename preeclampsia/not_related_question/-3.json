            "answer": "Just started getting the swelling as well and it's horrible! Drink tons of water, make sure your getting lots of protien, elevate your feet, and don't stand for support long periods of wear tight socks /shoes. That can help. In all honesty though, it's a normal pregnancy thing and we'll have to wait til after delivery for it to go away completely. Do mention to your doc just so he/she is aware. Swelling, when accompanied by high blood pressure and protien in your urine can be more serious. Sorry you've got it! Hope it's not too terrible!",
