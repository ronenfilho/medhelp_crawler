Additionally look for Pre-Seed they have a website and sell fertility aids such as tube that is sperm friendly, vitamins and even ovulation sticks in bulk. It took me 34 months to get pregnant but it was worth every moment to get to this point. My OB recommended Pre-Seed :).",

            "answer": "Thank you :). Sometimes when you are overweight you don't ovulate or don't ovulate regularly and exercise can help you to ovulate more regularly. It's also a good idea to get in shape/ideal weight before baby because it helps reduce risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes Pre term labor among other things. If mom is eating right and exercising it is a good model for baby as they get older and then they will take on these healthy habits too. I know working out is no fun but try to start slowly just walk five or ten minutes a day or take the stairs instead of elevator and things like that. If you drink a lot of soda try to cut back bc there are so many calories in soda that are not beneficial. I'd say don't try and do everything overnight or you will fail but start slowly and make gradual changes :) this will set you up to succeed. Also try the fertility aid vitamins from Pre-Seed they have them for men and women and the lubricant is great too. The ovulation predictor sticks can help you know when you are about to ovulate so you can time intercourse around ovulation for best chances of getting pregnant. I hope this info helps. I know how hard it is to try and try and try with no luck. This disappointment can become overwhelming but keep your eye on the prize, it will all be worth it when you are holding your baby! :)If you have any questions feel free to private message me. Take care and best of luck!",
