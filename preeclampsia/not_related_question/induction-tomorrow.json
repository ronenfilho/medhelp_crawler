            "answer": "I was induced at 37 weeks w. my son due to preeclampsia. It stunk because when they put the cervadil in you cant leave your bed, unless to pee. Which was ok the first day but after the 2nd day my butt started to hurt lol. I was not even dilated at all after the second day, my body was not ready at all to go into labor. So the doctors tried a diff method of induction meds (cant remember what it was). Still wasnt working so I got frusturated from sitting there and I said to the doctor ya think I could take a walk maybe it will help the process, and she told me that was a myth lol. Well I did a couple laps up and down the hallway and BAM contractions! Docs gave me morphine at pain for first and I was only in labor about an hour and a half before I was at 4cm and could get an epidural, then the docs tried givin me ambien to sleep after that and then my sons heartrate was dropping, had to have an emergency c section because the cord wrapped around his neck. All i remember after that ( because with all those meds I was gone!)\u00a0\u00a0was laying on the table and hubby saying \"what the hell is that, it looks like a big piece of liver\" i think he was referring to the placenta lol. Then there was my gorgeous baby, eyes wide open. Best day of my life :)",

            "answer": "I wish you good luck, and hope it works for you. I was induced 3 separate times but nothing would open my cervix. They even did a fully bulb that opened me to 3 but i quickly went back down to a 1. So i was sent home and told to come back in 2 days. The day i was supposed to go back i laid down to take a nap and as soon as i laid down my water broke. Babies come when they want sometimes lol.",
