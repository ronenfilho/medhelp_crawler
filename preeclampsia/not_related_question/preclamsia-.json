            "answer": "My sister was diagnosed with Preeclampsia when she was pregnant.. first they noticed her bp going up some so they put her on limited activity and told her to continually take her bp and if it got to a certain point to call...they also had her do the 24 hr urine.\u00a0\u00a0Her urine came back with a little bit of protein not too much so they did another in office test and the protein had gotten higher so she was induced that day.. she was around 39weeks.. they'll monitor you really closely.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily they payed such good attention to my sister and induced her when they did bc her placenta had already started to fail and Alysia's skin was really slack when she was born.. she was healthy just had the slacky skin from not getting a lot of the nutrients.. I'm not trying to scare you.. I was just giving you info on what my sister went through. goodluck and keep us posted!",
