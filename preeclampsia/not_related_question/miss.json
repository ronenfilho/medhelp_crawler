            "answer": "Dear Neeceee,Hope you are well. Did you have a second episode of seizure? There could be various causes for seizures in early post partum period, which are eclampsia, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, thrombotic phenomenon, following an epidural injection for anesthesia or analgesia, head trauma, amniotic fluid embolism. Preeclampsia can present late after delivery without prior eclampsia and brain swelling could cause blurred vision, headache even with the blood pressure remaining within normal limits.You will need close observation in an intensive care unit, with frequent blood pressure measurements, biochemical investigations even if your pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. CT scan brain, electroencephalogram should be done to rule out organic brain lesions. Supportive therapy and close watch are very important.You are welcome with any further queries.Wish you all the best.",
