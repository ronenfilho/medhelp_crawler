            "answer": "Well that really depends on a lot of factors. Babies size, your size, if you tear naturally or are cut, etc etc. I know some women who have had 100+ stitches and had surgery to fix down there while others have none. I personally had 2 tiny tears and 6 stitches. Childbirth is painful, I won't lie. For me, it was the worst pain I've ever felt but I also had back labour as well. It just depends on the female.",

You also likely will not see the baby once it's born either because you'll be in a recovery room.It doesn't matter how old you are, YOU made the choice for sex-- and the purpose of sex is to reproduce.

            "answer": "Age does matter in regards to pregnancy for many, many reasons. Women who get pregnant in their early to mid teens are at risk for complications such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, failed labor, and emergency cesarean sections. Some of those complications can be dangerous for both mother and baby. That's not a scare tactic, it's a fact that any OB/GYN or midwife will attest to. Just because you can get pregnant at an early age, doesn't mean your body is ready to. One woman's labor and delivery/pregnancy has no bearing on another woman's.Whether or not you tear depends on a great many things as well. But in general, most women tear. I had a 2nd degree tear and my epidural only worked on one side. I also had horrific back labor. I felt myself tearing and afterwards I was in a lot of pain and was swollen very badly and bruised. But, just because I tore and had a lot of pain doesn't mean you will. Delivery isn't made to be a cake walk, it does hurt.Cesarean section is a major abdominal surgery and most doctor's will not perform an elective c-section unless you've had a previous c-section. Also, most insurances will not cover an elective cesarean if you do find a doctor to perform one.",
