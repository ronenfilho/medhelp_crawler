I went into hospital I swear like 20 plus times and saw a few docs in ther plus I went and tried to find a doc who was a professinal in pregnancy and she giggld in my face when I tired to explain myself. I did see a naturopath or whatever you call it and see gave me iron magnesium and a few other things they did help but nothing has cured it. It just keeps happening. They did check my sugar lvls and it was fine. I asked them to check for diabetes but they refused to cause im not 27 weeks. They checkd my blood presure and only once and doc noticed it went down when I stood up so she told me to eat regularly and drink I tried telling her I was eating small meals 6 times a day like I was told and drank soooooo much water and im on top of it and she completely shut me down and said well obviously its not enough. How much can someone frign eat and drink. They tested all my lvls at the hospital and said I was fine only low vit D, then I told them how would they know when they only tested my blood when I came in and not at any other time while I was in hospital for 4 days. They were so surprised I had no blood taken while in hospital they did it the day I left and said I was fine. They dont give me any info at allll. I asked and asked and still got nothing they did do an MRI and found nothing they just say nothing to me.",

Consider it drowning from the inside out. There are so many issues going on but one switch could be having Gatorade instead of water. It will keep you hydrated but will replenish the electrolytes lost from the extra pee.",

I know you said that you have been to hospitals and other docs but seriously its time to start hunting for a good doc who specializes in pregnancy complications.\u00a0\u00a0They can be indicative of something serious thats an underlying problem. When you go to a doc, ask them if you are suffering from preeclampsia or eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these docs are so stupid that you have to ask them to check you for stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Also invest in a home blood pressure monitor and check ur bp on a regular basis. Check your salt intake. Drink atleast 2 liters of water a day.\u00a0\u00a0When you get dizzy spells, drop what ur doing and sit or lie down. You have to take control of your situation because youre living for twk right now. I hope this helps. Good luck to you and ur in my prayers.",

    "question": "Im currently 24 weeks pregnant with my second daughter, I have been to the hospital countless timesand visited about four different doctors. The doctors just smirk and go off subject so ive decided to just deal with it. Im sick of being treated like im stupid. Maybe yous can help me.So with my first pregnancy i was working at a charcoal chicken shop, at 9 weeks I experienced blurry vision, memory loss(I had no idea what a pumpkin was), numbness in my arms and legs accompanied by tingling, half my face went numb and I had trouble talking like I stutter and cant get the words out and talk really slow I got really tired and just wanted to sleep. I lost control of my whole body my legs didnt work at all. I got taken to the hospital and it was put down to stress(which is complete bs really) it then happened again at about 20 weeks and 26 weeks. Shes a healthy lil girl with no problems and was born at 40+6weeks. After her when she was 11 months I started going for runs, one of them runs my body startd going numb and my legs barely made it home, I just got in the door when I could barely move them anymore. I did work out with my daughter I get dehydrated so I had a hydralyte and it went away straight away. I get dehydrated a lot and have to hydrate myself to stay out of these states. Now it comes to this pregnancy betweeb 5-13 weeks was so tough I had all the syptoms as with my daughter but this time I also had episodes where I would faint/have a sezuire. Its in between them cause when it happens my body all goes numb mt head hurts but its not a headache and my head goes crazy and moves side to side really fast and it feels like my eyes are rolling back and I cant see properly but I know exactly wats going on and remember all of it. Expect one time it happened I\u00a0\u00a0the hospital when I was admited to see what was wrong and the guy accross from me in the same room told my parents it wasnt just me shaking it was the whole bed. That time I dont remeber all of it. After these things happen I shiver like im cold for the same amount of time I had the fainting thing for then I come back and im just really tired and feel really lazy. I couldnt walk for more then 5 mins between the frist tri cause my legs would go numb and i could barely feel them. Anyways I thought It was dehydration but no matter how much I drank and ate it would still happen. It all went away for about a month. Now its starting to come back I can feel it, I\u00a0\u00a0get tired really easy like I had just ran a marathon but really I just had a shower. I",
