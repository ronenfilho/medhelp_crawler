            "answer": "I guess it just all depends on the dr and everything. Because with my first child they were going to give me a pill vaginaly to help dialate and induce me the next morning. Well the pill they gave me kick started my labor and I had her 6 hrs later. I had the Iv for pain and the epidural. So that one was a breeze for me. Well with my son I was dilated at 2 for a week so we decided to induce. I went in and they gave me the potocin and I was hooked up to monitors. The potocin made contractions closer together and stronger. But my labor only lasted an hr. I didn't get a chance for any meds because I dilated from 3 to 10 with in the 15 mins that I was waiting for my epidural so that one hurt more then first lol. But this time I'm gonna try to do no meds again. See how that goes. I'm super nervouse though because how fast my last delivery was. Lol but that's all I went through.",
