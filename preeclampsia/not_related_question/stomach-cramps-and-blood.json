    "question": "im a ftm , 33 weeks 5 days . my pregnancy was fine until maybe a montj ago my daughter isnt weighing as much and recently i have had diarrhea and vomiting for three days straight then i became constipated, the whole time i was experiencing stomach cramps that resulted in me going into l&d . they just said i was dehydrated that there was nothing they could do but give me an iv . today the stomach cramps continued and i slept most of the day . i went to the restroom because i felt i had to poop when i tried i felt this big sharp pain that made me lift up off the seat. i figured maybe it was just a gas bubble then i wiped and there was a bloody mucus like stuff on the toilet paper. i called l&d and asked if i should be concerned because its bloody . they told me no unless it gets more bloody or i have close contractions . im still worried and would like some advice .*also ive began swelling in my face, feet, knees, and legs. i noticed my bp has been high also and i asked l&d if i should be concerned they said no im fine. idk if maybe this is contributing to me have bloody mucus and cramps . any advice .",
