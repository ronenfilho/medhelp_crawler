            "answer": "I have had protein in my urine since I was in my early 20s. It's never been at a high enough level for the MDs to get overly concerned. I've had testing on my kidneys and everything, and they can't find anything wrong. As far as pregnancy goes, I've also had it in my urine during this pregnancy, but not at a high level. I have had to do 24-hour urine collections a couple of times so he could check kidney function but, other than that, no big deal. I'm sure he'll keep an eye on it to be safe, but if your MD isn't concerned, I wouldn't be either.Protein in your urine can mean a couple of things...kidney infection OR preeclampsia. However, if you don't have any of the other symptoms of preeclampsia (mainly high blood pressure), the doctor will likely just keep an eye on it. As far as watching YOURSELF, just pay close attentions to fluid intake (make sure you drink enough water), and notify your MD immediately if you have abnormal water retention/swelling in your feet, hands or face.You'll be fine, little miss worry-wart!:-)Tricia",
