            "answer": "Levels of what were up?\u00a0\u00a0Bilirubin?\u00a0\u00a0If it's bilirubin, that's the compound that causes jaundice and that's why she would be under lights, not because of the low amniotic fluid.Does this baby have a heart problem?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering whether there is impaired blood flow to the extremities for some reason ie heart not pumping effectively or a problem with the blood vessels themselves.\u00a0\u00a0This can make a baby really tired too.\u00a0\u00a0Congenital heart problems can be associated with low amniotic fluids.Did your sister suffer from chronic high blood pressure, preeclampsia, diabetes or lupus during her pregnancy.Are the baby's kidney's okay?",

(which I didn't feel was necessary at the time because I remembered my gyno saying there would be labor pains, lots of water and there would be no doubt in my mind that I would be in labor and until that happens there would be no reason for me to go and see her).Anyway, after making that call to my gyno. she ordered me come in for check up and immediately sent me to the hospital to induce labor.\u00a0\u00a0It just so happened that that date was pretty close to the date the doctor suspected delivery if not right on it.\u00a0\u00a0I somewhat argued with the gyno. that I was not in labor yet, because I was not feeling labor pains, nor have I witnessed \"ALOT\" of fluid like she said I would.\u00a0\u00a0But apparantly, I was in labor for 11 days already and didn't know it.",

    "question": "My sister had a baby this last weekend.\u00a0\u00a0After several hours in labor, no dialation or baby moving down, and the dr trying to break her water twice they decided to do a csection.\u00a0\u00a0Once they got in they found she had no amniotic fluid.\u00a0\u00a0she had several ultrasounds during her pregnancy and one 2 weeks before she had her.\u00a0\u00a0None of them showed low or no fluid.\u00a0\u00a0The baby now had cold limbs and no matter what the dr's do they cannot get her body temp up.\u00a0\u00a0I have never known anyone that has had this happen before and being the mother of two kids myself I am worried she will not make it.\u00a0\u00a0They are going to do a spinal tap soon if her temp doesnt come up.\u00a0\u00a0She had to be under the lights for 2 days because her levels were way high after delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone that can give me some help would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0This is her first baby and I am praying everything will be ok.",
