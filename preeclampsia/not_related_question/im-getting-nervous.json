            "answer": "@dab 20.. They were boy and girl twin.. Boy weight 4/11 girl weight 4/09,,they was under the lamps to regulate body temps on for 24 hours.. They were on special formula which they had to be tube fed for about 5 days, then after they took them off and I was able to bottle feed.. They were still on heart monitors, but stayed a total of 3 weeks in the nicu.. I had to stay in the hospital also because I developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy, and after my deliver I still had high blood pressure, low iron, and low blood, because I lost alot during the emergency c section where they put me to sleep, and no one was allowed while they delivered them.. Now I have healthy two year old twins!! Best wishes",
