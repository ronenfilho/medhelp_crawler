            "answer": "I would let your doc know in the morning. But heart racing at times is normal, the further you get in your pregnancy, the more blood you are pumping. That's why the doctor checks your BP every prenatal to make sure your BP stays within normal level. You could've been having an anxiety attack, which is also normal but your doctor needs to know just in case they want to prescribe anything. Anxiety attacks can cause migraines and racing heart.",

            "answer": "You don't get preeclampsia at 13 weeks so you can rule that out. I had that happen to me while pregnant. It happened when I ate sugar. My heart would race like crazy. I told my midwife and she had never heard of it. No one had ever heard of it. Well I was ok but I ended up being induced at 37+6 for high blood pressure. My baby was fine the whole time and is perfectly healthy.",
