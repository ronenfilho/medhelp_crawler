    "question": "Yesterday I was admitted to the hospital for my blood pressure being really high. I was sent there from my doctor's office, my bp was in the 170s. Had to stay overnight to do the 24hr urine test and for them to put me on some bp meds. Everything has come back normal and my baby is doing fine. Hopefully with the bp meds she'll be able to stay in womb until full term. I've had a good pregnancy up until now. I'm high risk for the remainder :( But I'm\u00a0\u00a0grateful everything is okay now because yesterday was STRESSFUL! Hope you ladies and your little ones are doing well.",
