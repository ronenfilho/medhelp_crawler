            "answer": "I don't know, but I am right there with ya. :( I'm 30 weeks, stressful job on my feet, long days, no breaks 5 days a week and have class the other two.... As long as you're going to the doctor/midwife as you should be then you should be fine if they haven't said anything. You can always bring it up to your doctor if you want a little extra close attention/check up because you're concerned.... As for the pains, if they are \"expected\" pains, back, feet, etc, then no worries. But anything to severe, or unusual and I would call or even go get checked out... My back/feet/knees hurt like crazy all the time, I started to think maybe I should take my 12 weeks of FMLA leave early and rest before baby gets here, just save two or three weeks to heal after birth, lol. But then again I can really only afford to take six weeks off and want those for time with baby. :) .... Try to rest and feel better. (and good luck with the mother in law, mine lives a 1000 miles away and I'm fine with that, lol).",

            "answer": "Well I don't work but I can completely relate with you on the whole stress thing, I've been very stressed through this pregnancy. It definitely isn't good for baby when mom is stressed, but from what I read there are no long term affects to baby. With that being said you really need to try to relax your body physically and emotionally. ... It's not good for YOU. You need to be a healthy mommy for your little angel. You should speak with your boss and request a break and as for your mil let her know nicely she needs to get your input before doing anything for baby. Good luck and best wishes!",

It's illegal in the state of Michigan. My 1st pregnancy I had a miscarriage. I had a high level job stressful & a lot of lifting. I say be safe.",

And it's also been said that high stress during pregnancy can possible cause emotional problems down the line for the babies. But like I said, I only did light reading on the matter so you may want to look further into it. I wish you lots of luck!
