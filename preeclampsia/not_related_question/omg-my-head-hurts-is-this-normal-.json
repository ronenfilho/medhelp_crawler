            "answer": "any swift, severe headache that doesn't go away using tylenol or lying in a dark room with a cool or warm cloth on your head should be evaluated. that combined with dizziness could definitely be a sign of something severe, OR it could be hormones...but either way I would call my doctor and ask for some advice. if the pain is truly 'severe' you may want to go to L&D...severe headaches and dizziness can be a sign of preeclampsia. I wouldn't worry too much but either call your doctor or be seen, IMO. better safe than sorry :)",
