            "answer": "by law in the us, most obs cannot induce until after 39wks without a clear and urgent medical reason. and even then most women will need an amnio to check for lung development. some doctors know how to get around this so you may be induced before 39wks... but the rule exists to protect the baby from dangerous medical practices. try to hang in there mama, even though baby could possibly come now and be fine, every extra day in the womb lessens the chance of a NICU stay and lets baby's brain develop more efficiently.",
