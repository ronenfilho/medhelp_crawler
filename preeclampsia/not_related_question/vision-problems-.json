            "answer": "I have TERRIBLE vision. I had great vision until my 20th week. Freaked me out and I went to the hospital cause my vision was terrible and I got so dizzy at night I couldn't fall asleep. My blood pressure was perfectly fine until the night time, when it actually dropped a bit. But doctors say that's normal at night for pregnant women. Don't be too paranoid, not all bad vision means high blood pressure or preeclampsia lol. But talk to your doc just to ease your mind.",
