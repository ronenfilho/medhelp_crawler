            "answer": "I was induced but at 36 wks 5 days with my first cause of ageing placenta with my now 3 yr old daughter. Long story short 24 hr Labour and only got to 3 cm dialated when her heart Beat started going all crazy so I ended up with a C section but a healthy 4.7 lb baby girl. But come to find out with my second I was not able to push a baby out cause I have a small pelvis and he was 5.10 lbs and now im 29 wks 3 days pregnant and im going to have my 3Rd C section. Recovery for the first one was great and I wasn't in pain but for my second one I had trouble even getting out of bed. Im hoping this one isn't as painful as my second good luck",

            "answer": "I was induced at 38+4 as my waters broke but after 24 hours nothing else had happened. I was put straight on the drip as was already 3cm dilated but after 4 hours was still only 3cm they then decided that if I hadn't progressed any further after another 4 hours u would have a c section however my contractions then started getting very regular and a lot stronger I ended up having an epidural even though I was adamant I wasn't going to have one all the way through my pregnancy. When I was examined again I had dilated to 9cm shortly after I started pushing but then babies heartbeat started dropping and they had to get him out quickly so they used forceps. He weren't well at all when he was born and they rushed him off to work on him but he's a perfect healthy boy now. Induction was not pleasent but its so worth it when you have your little one here.",

    "question": "This Friday is my scheduled induction. Im so excited but at the same time I'm nervous. Last week when I was checked I was only a centimeter dilated and 50% effaced. Can those of you who have had inductions share your stories? From what I've heard it makes it seem like they usually end in csection. And those who have had csections how was the recovery?",
