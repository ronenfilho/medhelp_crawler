I am wanting a vbac this time but just a warning... its really hard to find a vbac supportive doctor. I'm in Florida and its one of the worst states because most doctors aren't willing to try. Do your research. Most docs try to scare you out of doing it but don't tell you the risks of a repeat c section are just as bad if not worse. I'm all for vbacs and am really pushing to have the experience of bringing my child into the world.",
