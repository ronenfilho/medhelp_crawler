To appease them I suggested that pain can be exhausting on the body and exhaustion causes seizures.\u00a0\u00a0They are more agreeable to that.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very minor heart condition and and sciolosis.After car accidents and returning to work...that is grossly hard on my back, my siezures return.\u00a0\u00a0I fell at work a few months ago and my seizures returned and became uncontrolled.\u00a0\u00a0If I control my back pain I seem to control my siesures.I am wondering if you have made any head way with your doctors in having them open their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure there are more of us out there.I wnat more than anything to get my life back, maybe we can show the medical community we are the precedent setting cases.\u00a0\u00a0After all we are the experts on our own bodies, they have just never came across cases like us or have never given others a serious listen.I am going to a world reknowned pain doctor and epilepsy clinic in the winter, they are going to work together to figure this out.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact me if you suffer pain and seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Strength in numbers...maybe they will listen.",

            "answer": "Reading these posts makes me feel good and bad, my husband is 27 in good health and very active he started having seizures after hurting himself within the past few years but it has started to happen more and more. He had surgery a little over a year ago because he had sleep apnea, they drilled out his sinuses and removed his tonsils, adenoids, uvula and scrapped down his tongue. He is now able to sleep without snoring and he can breathe through his nose. Since the surgery his seizures have been more often and worse each time. He just had one today because he hit his arm, it was painful but not that bad. I said that it seems to me an adrenaline rush from the pain causes the seizure its his bodies way of dealing with the pain. I really think that all the Dr.s who say this is normal or say there is nothing wrong are crazy. It is not safe or healthy to have seizures for any reason. I was wanting to know if anyone else has more than one seizure caused by pain? I ask because my husband always has one small one then he will come to then within a minute or so he will have one that is worse and lasts at least a minute or more and he always wets himself, which is the worst for him. I hope and pray someone finds an answer to this. It took me 6 years and 10 Dr.s to find out that I had Sinus Tachycardia and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Type 3 or Hyermobility type, I don't produce Collagen or Protein so my joints are deteriorating and there is no cure or real treatment. I have been dealing with it for my whole life without knowing until I was 22 I am now 30 and still hold out hope for a cure. I hope that I can find an answer for my husbands seizures soon it is a scary thing. Good luck to all of you and never give up hope!",

            "answer": "The following posts are very interesting. I am a neurologist and currently subspecialty training in pain management.\u00a0\u00a0After reading the above posts I would like to clarify a few points. Technically, pain is not a \"cause\" of seizures. Seizures are caused by both structural abnormalities in the brain, which can usually be seen on neuroimaging, or physiologic abnormalities which can not. Some people will have a lower threshold for having a seizure. For example, lack of sleep will lower your seizure threshold. This is why they do sleep deprived EEGs. It is very reasonable to presume that pain can be a \"trigger\" for a seizure in a person who has a lower seizure threshold. In fact pain can induce a vasovagal response that can also cause a loss of consciousness and subsequent seizure. So pain, albeit uncommon, can be a trigger for a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0Did you hear about all the people who had seizures when the Pokemon cartoon first came out? The flashing lights \"triggered\" a seizure in some people who were predisposed to them. In the end, antiepileptic medication treats both neuropathic pain and seziures.",

            "answer": "it is nice to see i am not the only one who thinks there is a connection between pain and seizures.\u00a0\u00a0i'm sure most of you have heard the general \"triggers\" (brain trauma, lack of sleep, stress, strobe lights, some sounds, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0i started going to the epilepsy center in the cleveland clinic 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0after some intense testing, scar tissue was found the right temporal lobe of my brain. the scar tissue is thought to be the result of a severe car accident my senior year of high school. (2005)\u00a0\u00a0i am now 23 and currently working on a master\u2019s degree in mental health counseling with a goal of earning a phd in counseling psychology.\u00a0\u00a0however since my car accident, the seizures have worsened.\u00a0\u00a0before the surgery, the seizures averaged out to around one every 3.5 weeks. in 2009, the doctors performed an operation called a temporal lobectomy where a golf ball sized portion of my skull was removed to allow the surgeon access the scar tissue\u2026the scared tissue was then removed\u2026.my skull was stapled back into place via titanium staples. this is now, the second winter i have experienced since the surgery, although the pain of \u201910 \u2013 \u201811 has been much worse than the \u201909 \u2013 \u201910.\u00a0\u00a0 the cold temperatures in the single digits have taken a toll and come with severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0the headaches are so strong, i can check my pulse by simply counting the pain sensations for ten seconds and multiplying by 6.\u00a0\u00a0with every heartbeat comes a throbbing pain. since the first of december, i have experienced three (the last two being less than 3 weeks apart).\u00a0\u00a0every day i had a seizure, i had been outside for some part of the day long enough to allow the cold to screw with the staples and develop severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0i do not believe that is a coincidence and pain can and are causing my seizures to worsen\u2026..although some say i am only looking for a good reason to move to florida.\u00a0\u00a0hahaha\u00a0\u00a0seriously though, if you do not live in a cold climate to be bothered by the metal, you may want to look into the surgery and to see if it may be an option.\u00a0\u00a0dr. william bingaman was my surgeon at the cleveland clinic. the clinic has a very helpful staff and i recommend the click to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0i hope this was helpful to anyone curious about the subject.....\u00a0\u00a0: )",

These \"episodes\" which I firmly believe are seizures seem to come in clusters and all happen when pain is introduced. He does not have them everytime he is hurt which makes it hard to know when to expect it. He has had approx. 10 total. Each one seems to be different in nature....today while at the hospital getting his cast off (I need to say when he broke his arm at school he had no issues) he was complaining it hurt when he tried to move his wrist because it was stiff. Well, the dr. felt his arm and he stated he was dizzy. I told him to breath and then he went into a full tremor and his eyes were really funny and in two different directions but he has never wet himself. The Dr. stated it was a seizure and needed to see a neurologist. I explained our whole story and how we have and even been in hospital and the MRI and EEG are always fine so the local dr. is sending us to a pediatric neuro for a second opinion. He ask to have that Dr. call him so he could explain to him what he witnessed. I am a nervous wreck always worried he will do this when I am not there and get hurt. PLEASE if anyone gets any answers update so we can get some relief from this unknown condition!!",

I was talking to my husband, asking if he thought that our son's siezures could have been caused by pain (is that possible)? and so I decided to look online for more information. It is reassuring to see that there are more people out there with this same problem. Hopefully, someday soon, we can get some answers. My son is 5, and has had two siezures in three weeks. We have never noticed him having a siezure before, but he just gets stiff and collapses with his eyes rolled back and is non-responsive for about thirty seconds. The last siezure he had was at the hospital to get his MRI. They had just put in his i.v., we were walking back to the room and he started having a siezure, but the time before that he was watching cartoons. There have been several times that he has had a blood draw or slammed his finger in the door, etc... where he got all pale and collapsed, but we didn't realize that this could have been him having a siezure.

I have noticed that roller coaster rides will give me migraines which will in turn cause me to go into seizures as well as rapid flashing lights will cause them. I have been on and off of medicine for this since I was 3 years old.",

    "question": "Please be patient while I explain my circumstances. I was born premature and they stuck me in an incubator and put a needle in my head.\u00a0\u00a0I still have the scar but it did not show up on the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0When I was a year old, at a department store, I hurt my finger and had a grand mal seizure.\u00a0\u00a0My mother took me to the pediatrician who yelled at her for letting me hurt myself.\u00a0\u00a0After that, every time I would have an injury, I would have a grand mal seizure.\u00a0\u00a0Examples, when I got bit by a dog, when I fell down a flight of stairs, when I get a really bad charlie horse in my leg.\u00a0\u00a0They thought that I would grow out of it but I'm 31 and I've had 52 grand mal seizures.\u00a0\u00a0In July, I had one when my back popped out in my family doctor's office (I had gone because my back had already started to hurt, then I sneezed and I heard it pop, and then it became extremely painful.)\u00a0\u00a0When this happened, I had a GM right in front of my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He asked me to see a neurologist as well as a cardiologist because I have a strange heart beat as well.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist did an EKG, a stress test and an echocardiogram.\u00a0\u00a0While on the treadmill, my pulse was up to 200 after 6 minutes and they made me get off.\u00a0\u00a0A week later they called and said that everything looked fine.\u00a0\u00a0I decided not to see a neurologist at the time because having seizures when I hurt myself was something that I've always done and they just said that it was my body's response to pain.\u00a0\u00a0Then, in November, I had a seizure out of the blue with no injury to provoke it.\u00a0\u00a0My husband witnessed it.\u00a0\u00a0I remembered feeling extremely dizzy (like always), and it kind of seems like the lights get a bit brighter. I layed on the floor and he said that my eyes rolled back in my head.\u00a0\u00a0Then I started convulsing and a few minutes later when I woke up my pupils were fully dilated and I had urinated.\u00a0\u00a0I was not awake for any of this, for this is just my husband telling me what happened.\u00a0\u00a0Nor was I awake at the doctor's office, for he described the same exact thing but of course, I was unaware of what happened after the dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Because I had never had one without pain causing it, I went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0They did a cat scan which turned out normal and referred me to a neurologist who in turn referred me to an epileptologist.\u00a0\u00a0The epileptologist did an EEG and an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0All came back normal except he said that there is something rhythmically wrong with my heart and that I need to have more tests done.\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate kept bouncing between 60 and 110 as I was laying there for about 30 minutes during the EEG.\u00a0\u00a0But my epileptologist said that pain is not a trigger for seizures and that he does not want to set me up for seizure monitoring since I only have seizures 3-4 times a year on average.\u00a0\u00a0He does not want to completely diagnose me with epilepsy because nothing showed up on the tests.\u00a0\u00a0He did up my dose of Lamictal and told me that I cannot drive for a year or take baths alone.\u00a0\u00a0He wants me to go back to the cardiologist for more tests.\u00a0\u00a0Am I the only one out there with pain causing seizures?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any patience and expertise in this area.\u00a0\u00a0I feel as if I'm the strangest human being on earth. It seems as if everyone else just yells or says \"ouch\" when they hurt themselves.\u00a0\u00a0What I wouldn't give for an \"ouch\" instead of a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.",
