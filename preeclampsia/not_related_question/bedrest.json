            "answer": "I've been on bed rest for 3 weeks and I'm 27 + 2. I was a customer service rep so I sat at my desk. I started to notice that it was getting extremely hard to breathe to the point I was about to pass out and the only way to feel better was to lay on my left side. I left work early to go to the ER and was placed on bed rest since then. My iron is low so standing was really hard. I have 3 other kids at home and my fiance helps me a lot. My oldest daughter is a big help as well.",

            "answer": "I was on bed rest my last two pregnancy it was really complected when at the time my oldest was 5 and I was a single parent I couldn't do much but lay in the bed. But I disobeyed the doctor because I felt really guilty because my 5 yr old was my life and I always felt like I was letting him down. But now I'm 34+6 and now got the help. But I truly think its a mind thing. You can do it weather you gave help or not. Don't do what I did cause I didn't listen to the doc and continue to move around I had my Lil one a month early. But congrats and good luck",
