    "question": "I have had some slight swelling so far throughout pregnancy. Such as not being able to wear my rings, etc. And I can tell when my feet are swollen, but they usually don't get this big. I am currently 27 weeks and 4 days pg. I work at a desk all day long, but I keep a big box under my desk so I can elevate my feet at all times. I don't usually cross my feet and don't think I have today. A few moments ago, I made the trip to the lil ladies room and my feet were really hurting in my shoes, so when I slipped my shoes back off, I took a look at my feet and I could swear my ankles are as big around as the thickest part of my calf if not bigger. This is alot more than normal. Right now I have my feet up on my desk but they don't seem to be coming down any. Are there any other symptoms that accompany severe swelling that I need to be aware of or that should prompt me to call the doc. Here is a short list of issues I have been having:Abdominal cramping kind of like menstrual period crampingI have placenta previa at this time, my next OB appt is Monday to see if it has movedSome headaches, dizziness, etc.Fatiguecraving Ice (OB checked my iron it is borderline low so that may be why this odd craving)Should I just shrug this off and bring it up on Monday or do you think this warrants a call to the OB.",
