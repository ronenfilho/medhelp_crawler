            "answer": "If your BP Is ranging around 140/90 or higher you will need meds. High BP can be a precursor to preeclampsia. IMO, 2 scans a week apart isn't going to accomplish anything at that gestational age. How is the baby's size?\u00a0\u00a0At 20-weeks it should be about 12-ounces. Perhaps they can do Doppler evaluation of your uterine arteries to see if the waveforms show notching. Notching can possibly indicate future preeclampsia. Do you know why the 2nd scan was ordered? Was your last scan the anatomy scan?\u00a0\u00a0You are not far enough along to have a biophysical profile (BPP).",

But I found out salt can raise your bp quite a bit and it's mostly salty foods that I crave. So i am going to try to cut them out and drink a lot more water.",
