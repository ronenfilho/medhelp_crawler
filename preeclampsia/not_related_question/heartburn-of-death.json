            "answer": "I thought i had had crazy heartburn at about 5 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I compared it to natural childbirth too!\u00a0\u00a0but the pain didnt rise above my breast bone aside from radiating pain.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up in emerge as i took the maximum amount of tums etc for heartburn and the pain was so crazy intense i was having trouble breathing. Turned out i was having a gallbladder attack and not heartburn. Thankfully they were able to calm itdown enough that it Didn't have to come out right then.\u00a0\u00a0I am scheduled to have it removed once my little guy gets here and am on a strick diet until then. Almost 28 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0Just watch that the pain actually comes up your throat to make sure it is indeed heartburn. And if the pain isnt coming up your throat then mention it to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I have no remedies to help other than lots and lots of cold lemon\u00a0\u00a0water.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully the pain goes away soon.",
