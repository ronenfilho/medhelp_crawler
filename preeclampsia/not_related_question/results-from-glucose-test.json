            "answer": "Do you mind saying if those of you who developed GD and/ore preeclampsia had risk factors like being overweight, older age, etc? I'm worried of getting these b/c overweight though lost weight before getting pregant but still considered overweight. I exercise daily but who knows how much longer I can do that as I'm now 26 weeks pregnant. I try to eat healthy but not the best - I like carbs and not crazy about fruits/veggies but eating more for my baby and my health since pregnant. I'm having the glucose test next week, so we'll see what happens. My blood pressure has been up lately at the OB b/c worried about these things but normal at home, but then she worries me about getting preeclampsia b/c of high b.p. but urine/blood tests normal for that so far. Sorry you all have to deal with this, but I worry about it too b/c of these risk factors!",

            "answer": "Gestational diabetes sux I got it with both times I was pregnant with my girls I was lucky I didnt test positive until 28 weeks and when your pregnant all you crave for is chocolate well I did and couldnt have it but apples helped my sweet urge. The main thing at the end is having a healthy baby my 1st ended in c section at 39 weeks 8lb 9oz and 2nd at 38 weeks 7lb 11oz. One bonus is after I had my babys I was slightly lighter than before I was pregnant I've now got to get motivated to change my lifestyle as im at risk for diabetes later in life. Sorry to hear what your going thru good luck for the rest of your pregnancy:)",
