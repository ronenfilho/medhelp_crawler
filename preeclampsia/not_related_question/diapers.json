            "answer": "OR when you get advice from someone who hasnt had a kid in over 20 years! Those are the people that irritate me! I have coworkers who havent had kids in years & they feel the need to jump in & tell me to do this & that... I appreciate the advice but its not needed. the further along I got, the more irritated I got with people trying to \"help\" me. Im not an expert by all means- but I have been around PLENTY of babies in the last couple years to help me answer alot of questions & to prepare me of what to expect. ha i understand completely! its annoying!",

            "answer": "Finally! I thought there was something wrong with me for feeling annoyed when I am bombarded with such \"good advices\". In my case it's my mom (32 years since her pregnancy) and her mom (over 50 years since her last pregnancy). I know they are only trying to help, but it's been decades since they experienced this, they don't remember everything clearly. Besides, what was thought to be right at that time might not be valid anymore. Hospital protocols and conditions, prenatal care have greatly changed since then. Plus, it's my pregnancy, it's gonna be my baby, not theirs! Pff..",

            "answer": "Just to give an example: my grandma still thinks that when you're retaining water you should reduce your fluid intake. I kept trying to explain it to her that I am at high risk with preeclampsia, I need to drink a LOT more water not less! And she's the one getting upset in the end because in her times there were some doctors who believed that limiting a pregnant woman's water intake is actually healthy. Since then this has been written off in the books as a harmful experiment of the '50s and '60s!",
