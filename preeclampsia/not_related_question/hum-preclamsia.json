            "answer": "I'm 31+3 weeks FTM and I'm developing preeclampsia and your bottom number is the one they watch the most. mine is over mid 130/90+ I also have protein in my urine. Each visit when you give urine they check it for protein so if your doctor hasn't mentioned finding any or had you do a 24 hour urine test i would say your ok. Swelling is very common in pregnancy. they look for swelling in the face and neck or the swelling that pits when you press into it. I also have GD which can cause higher BP and also retaining water can cause the extra swelling. My doctor is trying to get me to 37 weeks before we deliver because of the GD and early stages of preeclampsia. Your doctor is there for questions whenever you need peace of mind as well :) congrats and good luck!!",
