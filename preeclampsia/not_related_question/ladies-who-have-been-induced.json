I didn't know I had preeclampsia But it was at the severe point where I was throwing up all night and in pain. The placenta knows that toxins are effecting it and tries to rid the body of it. That's what my doc told me and Why my boy came early on his own. But even then, I had to be put on a magnesium drip for the preeclampsia and then pitocin too to speed up labor Cause magnesium slows it down.horrible horrible stuff Lol.",
