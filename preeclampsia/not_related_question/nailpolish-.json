            "answer": "What? Lol purple? That would only happen in loss if circulation and you'd feel that. It's fine to paint your nails as long as the room is ventilated :) I paint,my toes and get my nails done it's perfectly fine. Also another thing to watch for is random sudden swelling on one side. (one hand) it's a sign of preeclampsia. But that's got nothing to do with nails polish. Just something that kind of goes with your worry about not being able to see your nails",

    "question": "So just wondering is it ok to paint your nails since your breathing in the nail polish fumes. I redo my nail like every 8-10 days since that's when my paint starts chipping (thank goodness for essie nailpolish) also I've read and people talk about how your not supposed to paint your nails because you can't see your nails turning purple underneath or something like that. Can someone please elaborate?",
