            "answer": "It could be a few things. The first thing that popped in my head was maybe high blood pressure? That causes major dizziness and stress just makes it worse (of course lol). It could be extremely high and be preeclampsia, I've never had that so I'm not too sure about how that goes. Low blood sugar is another guess? And of course dehydration fits too. Maybe try to work on all of these and if it didn't help then I'd be stressing it to your Dr. I hope you feel better! That's scary!",
