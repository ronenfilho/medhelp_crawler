            "answer": "No that's perfect for your pre-pregnancy size. Do not cut back on what you're eating...most of what you're gaining now is baby's weight, so make sure and eat whenever you're hungry. yes it's best to make healthy choices (carrots instead of oreos) but don't cut back on quantity whatsoever.I'm not too much help on this because I gained a TON of weight after my miscarriage in 2008 so when I conceived my daughter I was no longer 130lbs..and I had gained some before from being ill for a very long time. I lost 20lbs in the first trimester, and gained 18 back....and lost all of it in the delivery room. So i gained -2lbs with her...but I was overweight to begin with. I'm having trouble with weight gain with this pregnancy...I lost 16lbs first trimester, gained 5, lost all 5 and I just found out I lost 3 more...the baby's still growing but the doctor's put me on a higher-calorie diet which I just CANT DO..i'm NOT HUNGRY, lol.anyway it's all different based on the person is my point AND the pregnancy...but for a girl of normal weight, 25-35lbs is the target weight gain for your pregnancy and you'll lose most of it in the delivery room due to baby, placenta, water, etc. So don't stress a lot of it will come off right away.",

I have been craving fruits all the time. I eat veggies too. First 13wks I couldn't eat meat. I eat 3 meals a day and 3-4 snacks. When I got girl scout cookies I ate a whole box at once.

BUT, i guesstimated i started at about 114...normally i fluctuate between 110 to 117. ANYWAYS according to my estimate of 114 and the doctor's scale ive gained 32 pounds (im 34 w 5 d)..UM so this seems like a lot and i think i might start just using my weight scale at home because i think that the doctor's is pretty subjective because its all about who weighs you and how they do it (since they have to balance the scale)...last appt about 2 weeks ago i hadn't gained anything and now supposedly ive gained almost 10...what? so anyways how much weight did you ladies gain with your pregnancy and how easy was it to lose? everyone says ive gained all belly but i know shes not 32 pounds lol so im a little concerned. going on a diet starting now...and no more oreos. well maybe only at night but i just have to finish this pack. :)",
