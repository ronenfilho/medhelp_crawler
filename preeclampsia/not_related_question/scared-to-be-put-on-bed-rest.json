            "answer": "Hi. I'm sorry to hear you're going through a rough patch. I can imagine the concerns you have. I'm 33 weeks and I have been on bed rest since the 29th of October. I had (and have) the same issues as you, with the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0However, mine was accompanied by high blood pressure. Have you been checked for preeclampsia or hypertension? That's usually what doctors are concerned about when there's swelling. Depending on the severity, you may not have to be on bed rest at all or it might be modified bed rest. I started out on modified before progressing to full bed rest. And in most cases, depending on your location, you can go on disability. My doctor offered to fill out the paperwork for me but I didn't need it. But it could be an option for you.",

    "question": "I'm 30 wks today & I've been swelling a lot over the past week. My feet had swollen up so much that my feet hurt and I can't fit any of my shoes at all!!! I've been elevating my feet as instructed and I thought I was eating pretty well (minus the couple of McDonald's fries splurges). But, I'm scared that when I go to the doctor Monday that he's going to put me on bedrest. Not only are my feet swollen, but my legs, hand, and it's in my gave as well!!!My child's father and I broke up so now I'm preparing for his arrival on my own. At this point, I can't afford to go on bed rest and not work. I still have things to get in order for my little prince. Plus, since he decided to leave, he has done NOTHING to help with the preparation of his son!!!Have any of you had this issue or been placed on bed rest??",
