    "question": "I am 7 months pregnant and my protein in my\u00a0\u00a024 hr urine is 964. I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, but being controlled with insulin. Also, I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. I am currently taking levodopa and adalat xl and my blood pressure is controlled with restricted activity (140's/80's). However, when I walk short distances ie: bathrrom or kicthen my blood pressure shuts up to 160's/90's and above. What should be my next step medically? I am being monitored weekly for my platlet levels and liver enzymes, I guess when those go abnormal I would be delivering my baby.",
