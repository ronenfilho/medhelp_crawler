I also soak them in wam water with epsom salt. But you should call your doctor just to rule out anything serious.",

            "answer": "I am in the same boat.\u00a0\u00a0They will need to check you to rule out pre-eclampsia or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0But after you see the doctor and everything checks out okay, it could turn out that you are an unlucky one that is swelling, like me.\u00a0\u00a0I had to buy a pair of men's size 9 sandals with velcro adjustable straps that will let out through the day, and that's all that will fit me now.\u00a0\u00a0(I wore a ladies' 9 before this.)\u00a0\u00a0My feet never go down all the way, even after sleeping at night.\u00a0\u00a0And mine will pit, too.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day the swelling goes up as far as my knee area.\u00a0\u00a0Elevating them above heart level helps me some.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suggested graduated compression hose/socks.\u00a0\u00a0I got a pair of the socks at K-mart.\u00a0\u00a0I forget the name of them but I think they are for diabetics and people traveling long distances.\u00a0\u00a0You can also get more expensive ones from medical supply stores.\u00a0\u00a0They help some, but you have to get them on pretty quickly in the morning before the swelling gets too bad.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, even wearing them I'm still swelling quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0And it can be hot wearing them when it's warm outside so I haven't been wearing them a lot lately.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely drink lots of water and walk around.\u00a0\u00a0If you sit a lot keep your feet propped up if you can and take breaks about every hour to walk around for 5-10 minutes, or however long you can.\u00a0\u00a0This is one thing that works against me because I sit at a desk all day and it gives the fluids time to pool.",
