            "answer": "It means its above the normal range. Normally 120s over 80s is normal, so if you are 130s over 80s you would be slightly elecated. This is usually from stress or anxiety. Sometimes if you just went up a flight of stairs itll be higher as your heart was pumping faster to supply more oxygen to the rest of your body. Dont worry if its only slightly elevated, they will usually check it again before you leave to see if there has been a change. In pregnancy, if it continues to stay elevated, it can be a sign of preeclampsia. If your doctor isn't worried then neither should you. I hope this helps but talk with the ob before you leave to answer all your questions and concerns and give you some preventative tips for the future to avoid the elevation in blood pressure.",
