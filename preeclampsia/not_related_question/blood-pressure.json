With my first the day I delivered mine was 170/140 and this time has been a lot milder with bp around 160/90. Remember the electric machines are not as accurate as the manual ones, and if you are worried like above said go and rest put your feet up stay hydrated and take it again in a couple of hours when you've stopped thinking about it and if its 140/90 then give your dr a call.
