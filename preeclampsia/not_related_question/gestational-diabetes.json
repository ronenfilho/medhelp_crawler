            "answer": "Hi darl, i just did my test yesterday for it, i get the results Monday. I got it with my other 2 pregnancies as well, so am definately expecting it to be positive this time too. I got to diet control mine, which is hard and annoying, but it does make you eat really well. If not controlled properly it can break down your placenta, which happened to me with my last son, he only weighed 4lb 14oz induced at 38 weeks. Am having a growth ultraasound next friday to see how this bub is going, i'll be 31 weeks. But don't stress, its completely manageable, and goes away as soon as the baby is born.",

            "answer": "Cool thanks, I've already got 1 child and didn't have it with her, so its weird that I got it this time. I also put on 30kg with her and this time have only put on 8kg so far, my daughter was 9pound 6, they say that they get bigger each pregnancy and now with the diabetes he will probably be bigger right? Did u have to have c section with ur kids?",

            "answer": "I only had a c section with my first, cause i had pre-eclampsia and needed an emergency caesar at 34 weeks. I went vaginal with my son 2 and a half years later. Having diabetes and having a small baby was weird for me, even the docs couldn't understand it. There is a risk that if you don't control it properly you can have a big baby, but in my case my placenta started breaking down and he wasn't getting much nutrition at all. I am a smaller framed person anyway, so they said i could just have smaller babies cause of my size. i dunno, i'm just hoping everything goes smoothly with this bub.",
