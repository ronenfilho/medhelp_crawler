            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. What you have is probably A pregnancy related headache. They mimic a migraine or tension headache. Usually there is a trigger, like a particular food or light or maybe traveling in a bus etc. Keep a headache log and see what are the common points, what food triggers it and doing what helps reduce the pain. Consult your gynecologist and get your blood pressure (this is ruled out), diabetes and thyroid status analyzed as any change in this too can cause headaches in pregnancy. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Can a neurologist do an exam and tell by certain things if someone has an unruptured aneurysm? I went to a neurologist yesterday and she did some things, not an MRI or ct scan, but some little things and said she didn't see any reason on emergency testing. I'm 35 weeks pregnant and have been having a lot of bad headaches since second trimester-pressure and pain. Just been very scared of a tumor or aneurysm in there.",
