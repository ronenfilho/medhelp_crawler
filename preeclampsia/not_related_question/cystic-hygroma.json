            "answer": "I am 18 weeks pregnant and my little girl was diagnosed with a cystic hygroma at 14 weeks. I had an amnio done and it all came back normal, so no chromosome abnormalities. Her hygroma has shrunk since it was first detected at 12 weeks. How big is your baby's hygroma? Where is it located? My doctors have never told me that my baby would not survive. Her hygroma is on the back of her neck and has gone from 6mm to 5mm as of 2 weeks ago. I have been seeing a perinatologist and I will also have to see a pediatric cardiologist in a few weeks to rule out a heart defect. Basically, get the amnio done. If it comes back normal, then you've eliminated that problem. They'll want to monitor the hygroma just to make sure it doesn't grow or extend to other parts of the body. If it's just the cystic hygroma with no other abnormalities, the prognosis is pretty good. I know if fetal hydrops develop, there is a 100% mortality rate. But again, if it's an isolated cystic hygroma there's a good chance of survival. Lots of these cases resolve themselves and the hygromas just diminish completely. I know I'm kind of all over the place, but I've been doing nothing but research for the past 5 weeks and there's so much information. I hope some of this helped....if you were even able to follow my randomness! I know how scary this is. Especially when you start researching online.....there are some really terrible things on the internet. If I can help in any way, please let me know!",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry you're going through this. I was lucky enough to have clear amnio results. However, I always thought to myself that if it had to be something, I'd want it to be Turners. Before I got my amnio results back, the doctors told me it was most likely Turners, so of course I went in search of support. I found so many women who have wonderful, perfect daughters with Turner Syndrome. There are so many growth hormones and treatments that eliminate so many of the issues Turners babies have. I'm sure you've done your research and if you're anything like me, you're more focused on just getting your baby girl to live to term. I know how scary it can be to just sit and wonder if she will make it. How is her heart?? Have they taken a good look at it yet? The fact that you've already made it to 16 weeks is fantastic! I'll be praying for you and your baby girl! Please keep us updated! Oh, and I don't know if this would help you or not, but I rented a baby doppler. The fact that she was at such high risk for cardiac failure was enough reason for me to rent it. It made me feel so much better to hear her heart beat every day. Good luck!!",

            "answer": "Your story starts out exactly like mine! I was first told of the problem at barely 12 weeks and she was diagnosed at 14 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 22 weeks now and as of 20 weeks, the hygroma was nearly gone. It's still there, but it hardly even noticeable to the untrained eye. I have since gone to a pediatric cardiologist to have a fetal echo done on her heart and that came back perfect. No heart defects! Now, there is no reason to think that I won't give birth to a perfectly healthy little girl. I'm telling you, I thought there was no chance. Everyone told me to stay positive and keep hope, but they didn't know the statistics. I remained optimistic, but realistic through the whole thing......it drove my family crazy! But I know the statistics and I know the odds and I'm telling you that there's a huge possibility that everything will be just fine for you and your baby. I'm glad you're getting the amnio done. Do you have it scheduled yet? Make sure you ask about the FISH test too. I got the results back in 3 days. It doesn't test for everything, but it tests for all the Trisomies like Downs and Edwards and it tests for Turner Syndrome as well. It was just nice to know the big things were out of the way so much faster than the full amnio results. I hope your amnio results come back completely normal and that stupid hygroma goes away all together!! Please keep me updated on your situation!! I'll be thinking of you and your baby! Good luck to you!",

This is our first. This past week at our 10 week appointment, our doctor noticed an irregular nuchal. He wants us to go for a second opinion with a prenatal screening specialist. That appointment is tomorrow, and I am scared to the bone. I just don't know what is going on and I am praying for my little baby to be healthy. Being a first time potential father it is really hard for me to deal with this. My wife is emotional and well I feel that if god forbid there is something wrong that we should discuss what our next course of action would be. It is really a horrible and somewhat lonely feeling being that it took us time to get pregnant. Really it is in gods hands now, I just hope and pray that all is ok. But being in this situation is just plain horrible being that we have been so looking forward to this. I know the screening is exactly that a screening and sets off alarms...but nothing is definite till you see a specialist. I just ask that if you can pray for our little baby. I thank you all and please keep this site going, you have no idea how mych you have helped.",

Per the physician the normal measure is 2.2 on the high end. So she told us there is a risk, she dubbed it as moderate. However this could also mean some sort of cardiac issues as well. Rather than taking a blood test and try and figure out what screening range we fall in we elected to go for a cvs. We should have the first set of results back by Monday. I've done some research online and well basically it is telling me stuff I already know. We probably have a 10 to 15% chance of something being wrong. We choose the CVS cause it is conclusive, we want a yes or no answer. I know some people will disagree, but not knowing for us is not an option. I just hope my little baby is ok. Again I don't know what normal is but from what I have read, normal on the high end is 2.2, so we know that there is a possibility that something may be wrong.

However, I was told that the normal range was between 1 and 3mm.\u00a0\u00a0I think you've made the right decision by getting the CVS done. The blood tests are so inconclusive....my specialist recommended that I avoid even doing the blood test. For us, we wanted an answer....not percentages. If you've read this thread you know that everything has turned out just fine for us. I have one more u/s with my specialist to make sure the hygroma has completely gone, but after that I'm done. A lot of times....especially if it's just a thick nuchal fold.....the connection in the 2 systems is just delayed. Once that connection happens, the fluid drains and goes where it's supposed to go and everything ends up completely normal. Sometimes I've wondered how many unborn babies actually have a thick nuchal fold, but it's never detected because in most cases an u/s isn't done that early on. I hope your results come back completely normal and you can just start crossing the potential problems off your list. If I could be of any help, please just let me know!
