            "answer": "An abruption can happen for many reasons. I have had to partial abruptions and the cause is unknown. Mine did not result in immediate delivery either time, but the last hemorrhage that I had was at 33 weeks. I had to be in the hospital for 3 days for them to stop the bleeding and the contractions that were due to the bleeding.Its usually a random occurance, but it can be due to the shape of the uterus. If youve had one abruption it does put you at a higher risk for another.Its nothing that you did, mothers smoke all the time and dont have abruptions, and although technically a scar in the uterus from a prior c section could cause placement issues with the placenta, it is unlikely.Sorry you had a traumatic birth, hope that you and your baby are doing well.Also, I am very sorry to the previous poster who lost a 29 weeker due to an abruption, my heart hurts for you, that is my nightmare.",

It honestly just really hurt my feelings for the post to say she's upset about having a premie, like really at least u still had your baby.
