            "answer": "I just don't like when people say Im small. Lol. They think since Im so small that my pregnancy isn't as bad. Pains and uncomfortable wise. With my first i didn't get a small belly till 28weeks and then i didn't get much bigger. But i did gain 75lbs my entire pregnancy due to preeclampsia. I got fully back to my prepregnancy size 2weeks after i delivered. All my friends said i had an easy way out since i didn't get big and i had a c section.With my son i had so many complications and he wasn't growing the best. He was born at 35weeks\u00a0and weighed 4lb 7oz. I guess i keep thinking if my belly gets huge than i know my daughter is growing and is healthy. Im shooting for a big baby too. Lol.",

            "answer": "Oh my gosh! Ugh those people make me so mad! Like we are less womanly because our babies were cut out?! Grr! I'd love to take the easy way out and just push my kid out! So many people give me attitude about it. It's like, if you didn't have a csection then you have noooo idea what I went through. Ugh..people..lol! I completely understand about being smaller though..that's how I am with this pregnancy. No one even knows I'm prego unless I tell them. Hopefully that belly will pop out for you girl. I know that must to go the entire pregnancy with everyone thinking that you are fine, when you're really not. People just can't see the tears we hide behind our eyes sometimes. Again..stupid people..lol!",
