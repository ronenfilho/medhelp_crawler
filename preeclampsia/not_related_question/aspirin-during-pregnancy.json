    "question": "I'm 12w5d with my 3rd. I have intrauterin growth restriction (IUGR) so my babies stop growing towards the end. I was induced early with both my girls. So naturally I'm high risk again. The doctor stated there is some research now that states a baby aspirin every day may increase the baby's growth. After thinking about it though I was very hesitant to start it and denied it. Both my girls were and are still healthy. They are monitoring me very closely during this pregnancy. Do any of you have to take aspirin? What are your thoughts?",
