            "answer": "My sister in law had her daughter at 29 weeks because she developed severe preeclampsia. To be honest, it was scary. We didn't know if she would make it being so under developed. They were both in the hospital for 65 days. She was in the nicu, in an incubator, and on a lot of assistance. But, she's now\u00a0\u00a0three months old and doing amazing. Healthy, happy, and growing normal. It's hopeful!",

            "answer": "I was rushed to hospital with PE at 28wks last pregnancy and they thought they were going to have to deliver. They told me baby would be fine but he'd probably have to stay in nicu until he would have been considered full term so 8-10wks. Ended up delivering at 35wks and 1wk nicu. I was told then it depends on their lung development and feeding but curious to hear others experience in case it happens again.",
