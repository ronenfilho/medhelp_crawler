She was having lots of diffrent difficultes and went into labor anddelivered her baby at 35 weeks.I'm not saying that will happen to you at all. I'm not sure what was causing her to have orange pee but I would want my doctor to know if it happened to me. It may have had something to do with her having protein in her urine... but again I'm not sure.Your doctor could give you a lot sounder information than me. Lol",
