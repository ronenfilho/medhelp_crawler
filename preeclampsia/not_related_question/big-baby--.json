I have a significant amount of stress and medical issues that are concerning him which is why he wants to induce so early. My job has me on my feet 60 hours a week and is giving me a hell of a time about sitting down or cutting back my hours, you would think I am the only person who can do my job. I can't afford to lose my job but at the same time my swelling is getting out of control and my blood pressure is skyrocketing.Be patient 5lbs at 33weeks is not that big it is a little big but manageable. The longer the baby stays in the oven the better for the baby.",
