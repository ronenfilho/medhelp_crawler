            "answer": "I agree, could be several reasons, but it's probably a good idea to call and tell your doctor about it. Maybe your baby has turned and is now facing your back (anterior positions), which makes it harder to feel the kicks. But either way, I would call your doctor...just to be on the safe side. Best of luck with everything!",
