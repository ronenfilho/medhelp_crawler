            "answer": "Me and my husband paid $40 and went three times out of the six classes offered.\u00a0\u00a0It was too far for us to drive at the time, b/c it was in another town (at the hospital) and it didn't start until 7pm and lasted til 9:30pm.\u00a0\u00a0It was during the summer once a week and the traffic sucked so it took us two to two an a half hours to get there and then an hour to get back, so it wasn't worth it to me.\u00a0\u00a0The lady rambled on and on about nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I could have read a book and learned more than what she taught.\u00a0\u00a0Some people get a lot out of the classes, but I didn't.\u00a0\u00a0I really think that it is good if you plan on having a natural birth with no drugs...thats where the breathing techniques come in handy.\u00a0\u00a0I on the other hand had an epidural and didn't use those techiniques at all.\u00a0\u00a0I had learned some exercises to help with the pain and didn't use those either, so it really depends on the person.\u00a0\u00a0Some people will agree with me and then again some won't.\u00a0\u00a0The next time I get pregnant I won't waste my money, b/c I already know somewhat of what is to come...b/c I plan on having an epidural!\u00a0\u00a0And to I got lucky and only pushed for 5 minutes and she was out...didn't expect that.\u00a0\u00a0But if you think you need them then I would suggest you take them.\u00a0\u00a0I would for sure take the breastfeeding classes.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't, but after I gave birth a lady came in who specialized in that and taught me a lot.\u00a0\u00a0It really helped and everything went smoothly...didn't hurt and my daughter latched on with ease.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I will quit rambling now.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "I didn't take any classes. My sister did and all the breathing/ focusing techniques went out the window when she went into labor ( she just wanted the epidural!). I learned everything I ever wanted to know by looking on the internet. There's a million sites. If I did have questions, I jotted them down for my next OB appt. Unless they're free, I'd say don't bother. Look online for anything you need to know!",

            "answer": "Hi! I think everyone has a different experience depending on the class and instuctor. For me, I wanted all the info I could get, even if I didn't use it! I was so nervous! I took lamaze, but I ended up having a C-section at 36 weeks for preeclampsia. I never had any labor at all! Not even one contraction! But, the class I took did go over a lot of other helpful info about what to expect. We actually spend very little time doing breathing exercises. Most of the time was spent learning about the whole birthing process. Good luck and see if you can get any more info about the class you are considering signing up for.",

            "answer": "I loved our childbirth class.I agree that it depends on the instructor and the hospital on what is covered etc. Our class covered everything you can think of: natural birth, epidurals, c-section, any problems that can arise, breathing, positions, a tour of the maternity floor, what to do when you go into labor. Tons of info. It was very helpful and I felt really prepared us for any type of situation. Just because you have an epidural doesn't mean you won't ahve contractions or pain; our instructor told us straight up that you still have to get ot a certain point in labor before they can give the epidural and its good to know some of the breathing or relaxation techniques to get you to that point. You can also get a tout of the hospital maternity floor on your own, but ours was included in the class. I would recommend taking the class as long as you have time. The nurses at the hospital will also help you when you are in labor, but it is good to know a lot of that stuff ahead of time too.",
