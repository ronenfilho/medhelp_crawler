            "answer": "I had tht a couple weeks ago. I would wake up with swollen feet. Or just being up for five minutes would swell them up. I'm guessing you have a kid already since this is your second pregnancy, i would say avoid picking him/her up && it's probably all the running around you have to do. When my feet were getting swollen i figured it was because i was constantly running around after a kid && i was up and down. Now that I'm home, my feet don't even swell anymore. Try soaking them in cold water or hot water. That relaxed me and it took off the swelling. Just keep your eyes on them, look for the preeclampsia signs && all.",
