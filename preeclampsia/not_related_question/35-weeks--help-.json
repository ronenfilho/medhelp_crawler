    "question": "I've been on bed rest for two weeks now due to high blood pressure. I had an appointment today and my blood pressure was super high but they got it down. My doctor said there is a high possibility of inducing me Wednesday (my next appointment) but I'll only be 35 weeks. Has anyone had their baby at 35 weeks or before? How long was the NICU stay? Was your baby healthy?",
