            "answer": "As long as your drinking enough water that you are not dehydrated you should be fine. I usually drink about 3 bottles a day and a gaterade, sometimes more, sometimes less. It all just depends on your body, there isn't a set number that you should drink. But as long as your peeing and it isn't orange, your not dehydrated and that amount of water is enough for you!",

            "answer": "Yes that is true you need to drink a lot of water & as your pregnancy progresses you need to drink even more because the water you drink makes up your babies amniotic fluid . Make an effort & drink atleast another bottle a day , everyday. So 3 bottles .Try ice cold water . It's my favorite , I can't drink it if it's not cold , that's why I recommend really cold water.I drink like 7 bottles a day lol I know it's a lot my dr says it's fine that's why my amniotic fluid is awesome so far .",
