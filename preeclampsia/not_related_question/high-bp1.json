They have me coming in twice weekly for sonos and non stress tests as well as the blood work and 24 hr urine collection for pre eclampsia every week. Im on almost complete bed rest. They tell me if my bp goes any higher I will most likely be induced at 37 weeks but that I will only have to have a c-section if induction doesnt work. I was still working as of last week and I was advised to stop. At least my bp stabilized now. Best of advice is relax and take it easy, the baby needs to stay safe inside until at least 36-37 weeks when it is considered full term and can be born with the least problems. Good luck!",
