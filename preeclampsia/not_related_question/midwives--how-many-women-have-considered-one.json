And everything about how they operate reminds you how birth is NOT a medical proceedure, but a beautiful and unique part of life as a woman! It's soooo wonderful how they avoid intervention unless absolutely necessary. You feel so empowered and confident as a laboring woman.Just browse through the articles on \"midwifery today\" website and they should have you convinced! ;)",
