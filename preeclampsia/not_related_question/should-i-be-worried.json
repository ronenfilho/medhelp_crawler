I have had diareah and extream neasua and dizziness for a few days and yesterday my lips, cheeks, and part of my tongue were tingly swollen and slightly numb, and for a few days in dim light or in the dark my right eye goes blurry and after awhile I can't see out of it at all until I turn on a light then it goes back to normal, I also have other symptoms but they seem like normal pregnancy stuff so I won't list them all but can any one tell me what's wrong and if I should be worried or call a doctor?!?",
