            "answer": "I had this happen to me with my first pregnancy. At about 32 weeks my fluids were low. I then started gettig Non stress test twice a week and my daughter was very small as well so they kept changing my due date. I also had preeclampsia so was put on bed rest. I went in the day before my newest due date and they told me I had to be induced. Turned out after I delivered my daughter that I should have been induced two weeks earlier and that I was just having a small baby. She was 5lbs 6oz when born and perfectly healthy. I would try and relax and take it easy and drink plenty of water in thw meantime. Hope everything goes smoothly for you!!! Best of luck with everything.",
