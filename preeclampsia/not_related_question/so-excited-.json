I did buy a body pillow and I have another three pillows that I put around me to help support my back and belly. It has helped me get a little more sleep, but with over ten pounds of baby resting on my bladder I get up about 8 times a night to pee. I\u00a0\u00a0like to tell myself I'm just getting practice for when I'll be up all night with twins. ;) The thing that helped me relax through shortness of breath is kind of silly, I just take long breaths in and out while counting to 5 (or reciting a prayer), it always helps me fall back to\u00a0\u00a0sleep. How far along are you? I wish I had more advice to offer for being tired at work, that must be really hard!",
