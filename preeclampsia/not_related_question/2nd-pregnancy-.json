            "answer": "My first pregnancy was twins, I couldn't even keep water down because was so sick. My second pregnancy was a little girl & I was sick but not terribly. My third pregnancy I wasn't sick at all, I'm being induced tomorrow and still haven't thrown up once. Each pregnancy is different, I'd say you're just fine and not being sick doesn't mean anything.",

            "answer": "Congrats!!My first baby was born early too, at 28 weeks - it was all very sudden, due to preeclampsia. Now, I'm almost 27 weeks with baby #2.I agree, every pregnancy is different. With my first one, I d always stressing and worrying, had lots of headaches and my belly was more and smaller. Now, I try not to even think about it, mainly cause I'm hoping to make it to full term this time.. No headaches, belly is higher and bigger.. But have a bad heartburn, more eight gain, and swallen feet..So is totally normal to feel different second time around. Just try to relax, you'be gone through a lot with the first one, I understand.. This time different is good!!Good luck!",
