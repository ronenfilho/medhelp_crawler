            "answer": "Went to the hospital with symptoms of preeclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0got diagnosed with it and then proceeded an unplanned induction. The first thing they did was give me a round of antibiotics through an IV drip. About an hour later they started the oxytocin drip on me. The first 8 hours wasn't bad. I had mild contractions but I wasn't progressing so they put a balloon cathedar inside my cervix. It hurt really really bad. Every movement I made caused me to have terrible cramping. It took me 6 hours to push the balloon through my cervix and then I was 5cm dilated. I waited a few more hours and got checked again, no progress so they broke my water with a medical tool. It was a huge gush of warm water and then I continued to leak for a few hours. They upped my oxytocin /pitocin drip and I started having terribly painful contractions. I contracted for and long time before they gave me the epidural. After the epidural I felt great but my blood pressure was rising and my baby was having irregular heart tones. After 30+ hours of induction my doctor told me I needed a c section :(",
