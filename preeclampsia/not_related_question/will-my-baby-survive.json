            "answer": "It's possible. Chances aren't high and there are often life long medical issues involved. I think it's 28 weeks before they say with confidence a baby will survive with medical problems. 32 before it will likely not suffer life long medical issues. Of course the longer it stays in the better. There are probably reliable stats somewhere online to give you exact percentages.",

            "answer": "it's possible, but extremely risky. Your baby's lungs haven't finished forming at this point, so it would need help breathing if it were born this early. Premature birth mostly happens between 32 and 37 weeks, and earlier than that it's much more dangerous. Are you in premature labour right now? Good luck, I hope everything is ok.",
