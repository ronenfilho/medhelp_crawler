            "answer": "Yes ut can affect baby by cutting off oxygen which can cause deformities, brain damage, and puts you at an extreme risk for preterm labor (can be as early as 30wks). Baby can get jaundice from smoking mothers, and have breathing problems. Some babys end up in NICU care for as much as 3 months after birth. Those are just a few risks to baby. You are putting yourself at risk for preeclampsia (high blood pressure). Thats the only risk I can think of right now to you, it mostly could harm your baby. If you want advixe on substitution, not only does water help bc it can replace the need for the repetitice hand motion, it also helps cleanse the nicotine from the body quicker. Good luck to you and your baby momma.",

It is hard and I have gone days, weeks without it and always end up doing it again. Just keep trying. If you slip don't beat yourself up. Just know that it's an addiction and you can only do your best. Also there are hotlines that you can call when you feel the need to smoke or just to talk. But most importantly don't try to force yourself. For this will only make you crave more. Try and stay busy, sleep, eat and stay away from routine things that makes you want a cig.Also if you ever want to chat or just have Someone that you can fight this addictions over with. Feel free to message me anytime. Good luck sweetheart",

I can make a pack of cigarettes last me for about two weeks. I have one of those vapor pens but I'm scared to death to use it cause it apparently makes people sick. People are going to judge you on everything you do pregnant or not. I had a woman on another app tell me I was pretty much a horrible parent since I didn't quit all the way. I smoked with my first pregnancy and he's four years old and in perfect health and my daughter is the same way. Matter of fact she's measuring two weeks ahead of whats she suppose to be.",
