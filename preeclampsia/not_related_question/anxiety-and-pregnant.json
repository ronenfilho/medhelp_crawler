You may want to ask your o.b. this question \"which will cause more damage to my babies, xanax or stress hormones\".. I really don't know what his answer will be, because only he will know the severity of your anxiety based on what you tell him. But no matter what, be honest, don't over embellish. Think about your little ones and concentrate on a healthy pregnancy and the attacks will come less frequently. I wish you lots of luck..",

I thought for sure it was because I was anxious. I get the worse butterflies and unreal feelings and at the pit of myh stomach I sometimes feel like I skip a beat sometimes. But I realized that is not why. you can take your medicines maybe not zanx as much as zoloft or fluxotine. But know if something is going to happen its going to because that is gods plan. Dont look on the internet for negative things that will be my goal for the next time I try to get pregnant. Its a stressfull world out there just keep telling yourself you are stronger than everyone else you can't control that you have anxiety but you can control how you want to take care of it. good luck. you are the one who can get yourself through it.",

Now, I am happy, the baby is doing well, and no side effects. I take 50mg of Zoloft every morning, and I am not the only mommy to be on this site that takes it. IT is very safe, and in fact safer than the stress it causes the baby for you to be having panic attacks all the time. Call your doc and ask about ZOloft.",

I was on xanax 0.5 mg extended release and it helped me out a lot.\u00a0\u00a0my md insisted on getting off the medication due to becoming addicted to it. About a month ago i slowly started tappering off going to xanax 0.25 mg to half of that every other day its been 2and a half weeks and i havent used it sure i got withdrawal symtoms like muscle spasms on my neck, anxiousness and nausea but it went away and now im five weeks pregnant! i had a miscarriage a year ago not on any meds and im sure if you talk to your doctor he'll find a way to help you and keep you comfortable. Im focusing on my baby to keep me from taking any, but trust me if i find myself needing one (since my husband will be leaving to afghanistan in two weeks) i will ask my obgyn if i could take half of one. Try exercise it sends endorphins to your brain and therapy with a counseler but dont rely on xanax for it only numbs the feeling find out what triggers your anxiety and dont give up, keep busy and go to church. Get on these groups and keep a support system just know you are not alone.",
