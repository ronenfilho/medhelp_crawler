    "question": "Every morning or any time I take a nap and wake up, I wake up to my hands so swollen. I understand if I sleep on them, the blood flow slows down and leaves you with that tingly numb feeling and then it goes away but lately its been taking awhile for my hands to go back to normal. Including my wrist, just trying to push myself off the bed to use the bathroom they feel like they wanna break :( so uncomfortable. Sometimes my fingers just feel like they need to be popped / cracked but wont. My hands are just so uncomfortable at times, any ideas to help swollen hands ?",
