            "answer": "No the horror stories are not always true. I was induced with my first, had zero complications, no c section, and labor was only a few hours not days. I'm going to be induced with this one here on the 18th too. Your doctor is simply looking out for what is best for you and the baby. The swelling and sky high bp is far from good for either of you, I wouldn't risk waiting it out.",

            "answer": "Remember that lots of woman get induced as a last resort when they go over due and it gets to that point where its safer to get baby out then to risk the placenta getting old... so on that note it does make sense that inductions can lead to csections as there may have been a reason that was preventing labor from occuring to begin with..... like for example with me i was induced and it was aweful BUT my daughter was face up and head arched back, she never dropped and was never going to(stuck and pressing on my spine)... its that simple so i was pre marked as a cesection before i even started (if i had known that earlier it would have been nice lol) but my point is some babies are too big or are in a bad position where they dont drop or whatever and thats why labor doesnt start, so the induction is started and fails... There are lots of mommas out there that get induced and have awesome results and you cant focus on the bad.... there is always a risk to having a csection and they can occur with natural labor as well... if your dr is concerned about your BP then you do have to add that into if you choose to get induced or not... bt dont listen to those stories and really thats nice of them to share them with you at this time!?",

            "answer": "I complely agree with lesley27. Your doc wants whats best for you and baby. My neighbor was induced and her labour lasted 36hrs but they refused to break her water, she had her daughter 5hrs after she made them break her water. For the most part being induced isnt bad at all, it really depends on your body and psin tolerence which is the same for natural birth",

If you go in with no signs of dilation or thinning out then I think it's going to take longer and it'll be much more difficult to start up.It's different for everyone. Maybe your doc doesn't want it to turn into preeclampsia?",
