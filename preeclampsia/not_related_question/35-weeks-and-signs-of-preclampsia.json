My sis woke up fine but only after emergency c section for twins. She doesn't remember what happened. She was not closely monitored either, but if her husband wasn't home, who knows what would have happened. On a possitive note, the kids are both fine and 3 years old now. Sis is great too. Good luck!!",

If not go get it, it's a documentary. I suggest then talking to a certified midwife in your area about all your symptons and the question should arise.....do you need a c -section a all....do you even need to be induced at all?? Theres a great chance that you don't and you should be able to labor naturally and your baby is fine. Just sayin is all.....",

            "answer": "this post is from a year ago, but i figured i'd update in case it can help someone in the future.when i posted i was 35 weeks 3 days. he did a blood draw that day (thursday), and i did a 24 hr urine sample. i went back the next day (friday) and did another blood draw to see my platelet count was and to determine my liver function. Monday morning the dr called me and told me we had to have the c-section that day. protein was spilling into my urine, and my platelets were getting low. all weekend i had felt very sick. in retrospect, i probably should have gone to the hospital. the workup before the c-section showed +4 protein in urine. i could barely stay awake waiting for the c-sec and felt terrible. i never would have been able to go through labor at that point. if he hadn't called me with the test results and told me to go in, i definitely would have on my own. the u/s right before showed that the placenta had deteriorated further, and my fluid levels were going down. my baby was born 4 lbs 13 oz. at exactly 36 weeks. she was smaller than expected, and that was probably due to the fact that she wasn't getting nourishment anymore. her lungs were OK, thank god. the ob said that often the baby's lungs mature faster when the mother is in distress.i feel that without the c-section, both me and my baby's life would have been in danger. i am very greatful to my doctor and the wonderful care i received.",

    "question": "i just got back from my dr appt. i am 35 wks 3 days. i have some protein in my urine, my bp was high at first, but did go down after laying on my left side. my dr does an u/s at every visit, so he knows what's normal for me. this time he saw some calcification of the placenta, and my fluid levels, which are normally great, are getting lower. her weight is still right on target and she's 5 lbs,8oz.\u00a0\u00a0he did a blood draw and will repeat tomorrow. i am also doing a 24 hr urine sample.he told me he doesn't think i'll make it to 40 weeks and that they'll have to take her early. he also said that if it's before 37 or 38 weeks, i'd probably just have to go ahead and do a c-section because the cervix will not be close enough to ready, even with drugs. he is going to see me twice a week now, until they decide we can't wait any longer. it could be as early as next week (at 36 wks), and we may make it to 37 or 38.i don't even know what my question is really. i was a little surprised that they would go straight to a c-section without trying inducing first. i guess they'll do whatever necessary to make sure both baby and i are ok. i am not ready for this, and may not even last until my shower!!! poor dh had such a panicked look in his eyes.",
