            "answer": "I had it during week's 33-35. I barely slept during that time and couldn't do anything to ease the pain. It was terrible. I took Tylenol and put a hot water bag plus vicks. I am now 39+2 and haven't had the problem since. It's nothing bad but sadly it wont go away till your baby goes into head down position. That was the only thing that relieve and took away my pain. Just as my doctor had told me. Hope you feel better",
