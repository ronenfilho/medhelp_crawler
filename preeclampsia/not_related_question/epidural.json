            "answer": "This is my 2nd baby and I am getting an epidural. I had a 23-24 hr labor with my 1st and got an epidural by the end of it. the epidural was great because it allowed me to get a little rest before the baby arrived. It also helped me to enjoy the birthing process with my husband better because I wasnt in pain or super cranky with him. It wasnt painful to get either, I would take that one poke over pitocin induced labor contractions any day lol",

            "answer": "I had an epidural with my first child. It was great but wore off toward the end. The doc said it was too late to get more because it was time to push. So I had great relief from contractions but felt ALL of the pushing down the birth canal. I feel like I can go without one this birth but I have preeclampsia and my blood pressure is already high. I know sometimes docs recommend epidurals to help when mom or baby's bp becomes elevated because of the stress and the pain. Its also good to have one in case of the need for an emergency c section it is already in place. Since I am high risk I know these are both possibilities so I may get one again just in case. I'm still debating, though I don't have long, I'm being induced at midnight. I may just go for so long and if I think I need it I'll ask for my doc to give it to me.",

Finally she realized her mistake! But the epidual made it relaxing from then on and i was able to get some rest.",

            "answer": "I did all natural with my first daughter who is now 6.5, I don't believe in the epidural and it also scares the living crap out of me since there are life changing side effects that could happen. I'm now 34 weeks with my second daughter and still plan to go all natural. It makes for a faster delivery if you ask me plus shorter recovery time and time in the hospital. If there is any kind of emergency that happens I ask that I just be knocked out with anesthesia no epidural, epidurals also don't work sometimes like with my best friend. you do what you want and think is best for you and your baby :-)",
