            "answer": "Dizzy spells would not be a reason you would be put on bedrest. Usually preterm labor or preeclampsia is the reason for bedrest. I would mention it to your dr however, make sure your blood pressure is okay and your staying hydrated.I was worried I would be put on bedrest since I'm having twins and almost to 34 weeks I never was and won't be now. I did however have to stop working around 30 weeks because I was no longer able to stay on my feet for long periods and do all the bending.",

            "answer": "I did that with my last pregnancy nd I had developed tarchcardia. It's pretty much my heart rate was high n making me feel dizzy nd sick. Talk to your dr about this. If your heart rate is up so is your baby's. it caused my baby girl to have a sped up heart rate nd she now has it for life nd I ignored the signs. They sent me to a cardiologist nd I had to wear a holster moniter for 2 weeks. But if you catch it early they can put you on bed rest or whatever to keep your heart rate down. Most cases r minor. Nd I am not trying to scare you so please don't take it that way. Jus know I was scared nd wished someone had told me. It's better to be safe ya know",
